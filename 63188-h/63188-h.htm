<p><i>Of all the arts and half-arts&mdash;perhaps
even above that of acting&mdash;is the art of
criticism founded most greatly upon
vanity. All criticism is, at bottom, an
effort on the part of its practitioner to
show off himself and his art at the expense
of the artist and the art which he
criticizes. The heavy modesty practised
by certain critics is but a recognition of,
and self-conscious attempt to diminish,
the fundamental and ineradicable vainglory
of criticism. The great critics are
those who, recognizing the intrinsic, permanent
and indeclinable egotism of the
critical art, make no senseless effort to
conceal it. The absurd critics are those
who attempt to conceal it and, in the
attempt, make their art and themselves
doubly absurd.</i></p></div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap2">ART is a reaching out into the ugliness
of the world for vagrant beauty and
the imprisoning of it in a tangible
dream. Criticism is the dream book. All art
is a kind of subconscious madness expressed in
terms of sanity; criticism is essential to the
interpretation of its mysteries, for about
everything truly beautiful there is ever something
mysterious and disconcerting. Beauty
is not always immediately recognizable as
beauty; what often passes for beauty is mere
infatuation; living beauty is like a love that
has outlasted the middle-years of life, and has
met triumphantly the test of time, and faith,
and cynic meditation. For beauty is a sleep-walker
in the endless corridors of the wakeful
world, uncertain, groping, and not a little
strange. And criticism is its tender guide.</p>

<p>Art is a partnership between the artist and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
the artist-critic. The former creates; the
latter re-creates. Without criticism, art
would of course still be art, and so with its
windows walled in and with its lights extinguished
would the Louvre still be the Louvre.
Criticism is the windows and chandeliers of
art: it illuminates the enveloping darkness in
which art might otherwise rest only vaguely
discernible, and perhaps altogether unseen.</p>

<p>Criticism, at its best, is a great, tall candle
on the altar of art; at its worst, which is to say
in its general run, a campaign torch flaring red
in behalf of &#230;sthetic ward-heelers. This campaign
torch motif in criticism, with its
drunken enthusiasm and raucous hollering
born of ignorance, together with what may be
called the Prince Albert motif, with its sober,
statue-like reserve born of ignorance that, being
well-mannered, is not so bumptious as the
other, has contributed largely to the common
estimate of criticism as a profession but
slightly more exalted than Second Avenue
auctioneering if somewhat less than Fifth.
Yet criticism is itself an art. It might,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
indeed, be well defined as an art within an art,
since every work of art is the result of a struggle
between the heart that is the artist himself
and his mind that is the critic. Once his work
is done, the artist&#8217;s mind, tired from the bitterness
of the struggle, takes the form of a second
artist, puts on this second artist&#8217;s strange hat,
coat and checkered trousers, and goes forth
with refreshed vigour to gossip abroad how
much of the first artist&#8217;s work was the result
of its original splendid vitality and how much
the result of its gradually diminished vitality
and sad weariness. The wrangling that
occurs at times between art and criticism is,
at bottom, merely a fraternal discord, one in
which Cain and Abel belabour each other with
stuffed clubs. Criticism is often most sympathetic
when it is apparently most cruel: the
propounder of the sternest, hardest philosophy
that the civilized world has known never failed
sentimentally to kiss and embrace his sister,
Therese Elisabeth Alexandra Nietzsche, every
night at bed-time. &#8220;It is not possible,&#8221; Cabell
has written, &#8220;to draw inspiration from a woman&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
beauty unless you comprehend how easy
it would be to murder her.&#8221; And&mdash;&#8220;Only
those who have firmness may be really tender-hearted,&#8221;
said Rochefoucauld. One may
sometimes even throw mud to tonic purpose.
Consider Karlsbad.</p>

<p>Art is the haven wherein the disillusioned
may find illusion. Truth is no part of art.
Nor is the mission of art simple beauty, as the
text books tell us. The mission of art is the
magnification of simple beauty to proportions
so heroic as to be almost overpowering. Art
is a gross exaggeration of natural beauty:
there was never a woman so beautiful as the
Venus di Milo, or a man so beautiful as the
Apollo Belvedere of the Vatican, or a sky so
beautiful as Monet&#8217;s, or human speech so beautiful
as Shakespeare&#8217;s, or the song of a nightingale
so beautiful as Ludwig van Beethoven&#8217;s.
But as art is a process of magnification, so
criticism is a process of reduction. Its purpose
is the reducing of the magnifications of
art to the basic classic and &#230;sthetic principles,
and the subsequent announcement thereof in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
terms proportioned to the artist&#8217;s interplay of
fundamental skill and overtopping imagination.</p>

<p>The most general fault of criticism lies in a
confusion of its own internal processes with
those of art: it is in the habit of regarding the
business of art as a reduction of life to its
essence of beauty, and the business of criticism
as an expansion of that essence to its
fullest flow. The opposite is more reasonable.
Art is a beautiful, swollen lie; criticism, a cold
compress. The concern of art is with beauty;
the concern of criticism is with truth. And
truth and beauty, despite the Sunday School,
are often strangers. This confusion of the
business of art and that of criticism has given
birth to the so-called &#8220;contagious,&#8221; or inspirational,
criticism, than which nothing is more
mongrel and absurd. Criticism is designed to
state facts&mdash;charmingly, gracefully, if possible&mdash;but
still facts. It is not designed to exhort,
enlist, convert. This is the business not of
the critic, but of those readers of the critic
whom the facts succeed in convincing and galvanizing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Contagious criticism is merely a
vainglorious critic&#8217;s essay at popularity: facts
heated up to a degree where they melt into
caressing nothingness.</p>

<p>But if this &#8220;criticism with a glow&#8221; is not to
be given countenance, even less is to be suffered
the criticism that, in its effort at a fastidious
and elegant reserve, leans so far backward
that it freezes its ears. This species of criticism
fails not only to enkindle the reader, but
fails also&mdash;and this is more important&mdash;to enkindle
the critic himself. The ideal critic is
perhaps much like a Thermos bottle: full of
warmth, he suggests the presence of the heat
within him without radiating it. This inner
warmth is essential to a critic. But this inner
warmth, where it exists, is automatically
chilled and banished from a critic by a
protracted indulgence in excessive critical
reserve. Just as the professional frown
assumed by a much photographed public magnifico
often becomes stubbornly fixed upon his
hitherto gentle brow, so does the prolonged
spurious constraint of a critic in due time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
psychologically hoist him on his own petard.
A writer&#8217;s work does not grow more and more
like him; a writer grows more and more like
his work. The best writing that a man produces
is always just a little superior to himself.
There never was a literary artist who did not
appreciate the difficulty of keeping up to the
pace of his writings. A writer is dominated
by the standard of his own writings; he is a
slave <i>in transitu</i>, lashed, tormented, and miserable.
The weak and inferior literary artist,
such a critic as the one alluded to, soon
becomes the helpless victim of his own writings:
like a vampire of his own creation they
turn upon him and suck from him the warm
blood that was erstwhile his. A pose in time
becomes natural: a man with a good left eye
cannot affect a monocle for years without
eventually coming to need it. A critic cannot
write ice without becoming in time himself
at least partly frosted.</p>

<p>Paraphrasing Pascal, to little minds all
things are great. Great art is in constant
conflict with the awe of little minds. Art is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
something like a wonderful trapeze performer
swinging high above the heads of the bewildered
multitude and nervous lest it be made
to lose its balance and to slip by the periodic
sudden loud marvellings of the folks below.
The little mind and its little criticism are the
flattering foes of sound art. Such art
demands for its training and triumph the
countless preliminary body blows of muscular
criticism guided by a muscular mind. Art
and the artist cannot be developed by mere
back-slapping. If art, according to Beul&#233;, is
the intervention of the human mind in the
elements furnished by experience, criticism is
the intervention of the human mind in the
elements furnished by &#230;sthetic passion. Art
and the artist are ever youthful lovers; criticism
is their chaperon.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>I do not believe finally in this or that
&#8220;theory&#8221; of criticism. There are as many
sound and apt species of criticism as there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
are works to be criticized. To say that art
must be criticized only after this formula or
after that, is to say that art must be contrived
only out of this formula or out of that. As
every work of art is an entity, a thing in itself,
so is every piece of criticism an entity, a thing
in itself. That &#8220;Thus Spake Zarathustra&#8221;
must inevitably be criticized by the canons of
the identical &#8220;theory&#8221; with which one criticizes
&#8220;Tristan and Isolde&#8221; is surely difficult of
reasoning.</p>

<p>To the Goethe-Carlyle doctrine that the
critic&#8217;s duty lies alone in discerning the artist&#8217;s
aim, his point of view and, finally, his execution
of the task before him, it is easy enough
to subscribe, but certainly this is not a &#8220;theory&#8221;
of criticism so much as it is a foundation for
a theory. To advance it as a theory, full-grown,
full-fledged and flapping, as it has been
advanced by the Italian Croce and his admirers,
is to publish the preface to a book without
the book itself. Accepted as a theory complete
in itself, it fails by virtue of its several undeveloped
intrinsic problems, chief among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
which is its neglect to consider the undeniable
fact that, though each work of art is indubitably
an entity and so to be considered, there
is yet in creative art what may be termed an
&#230;sthetic genealogy that bears heavily upon
comprehensive criticism and that renders the
artist&#8217;s aim, his point of view and his execution
of the task before him susceptible to a
criticism predicated in a measure upon the
work of the sound artist who has just preceded
him.</p>

<p>The Goethe-Carlyle hypothesis is a little too
liberal. It calls for qualifications. It gives
the artist too much ground, and the critic too
little. To discern the artist&#8217;s aim, to discern
the artist&#8217;s point of view, are phrases that
require an amount of plumbing, and not a
few foot-notes. It is entirely possible, for
example, that the immediate point of view of
an artist be faulty, yet the execution of his
immediate task exceedingly fine. If carefully
planned triumph in art is an entity, so also
may be undesigned triumph. I do not say
that any such latter phenomenon is usual, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
it is conceivable, and hence may be employed
as a test of the critical hypothesis in point.
Unschooled, without aim or point of view in
the sense of this hypothesis, Schumann&#8217;s compositions
at the age of eleven for chorus and
orchestra offer the quasi-theory some resistance.
The question of the comparative merit
of these compositions and the artist&#8217;s subsequent
work may not strictly be brought into
the argument, since the point at issue is merely
a theory and since theory is properly to be
tested by theory.</p>

<p>Intent and achievement are not necessarily
twins. I have always perversely thought it
likely that there is often a greater degree of
accident in fine art than one is permitted to
believe. The aim and point of view of a
bad artist are often admirable; the execution
of a fine artist may sometimes be founded upon
a point of view that is, from an apparently
sound critical estimate, at striking odds with
it. One of the finest performances in all modern
dramatic writing, upon its critical reception
as such, came as a great surprise to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
writer who almost unwittingly had achieved
it. Art is often unconscious of itself. Shakespeare,
writing popular plays to order, wrote
the greatest plays that dramatic art has
known. Mark Twain, in a disgusted moment,
threw off a practical joke, and it turned out to
be literature.</p>

<p>A strict adherence to the principles enunciated
in the Goethe-Carlyle theory would
result in a confinement of art for all the theory&#8217;s
bold aim in exactly the opposite direction.
For all the critic may accurately say,
the aim and point of view of, say, Richard
Strauss in &#8220;Don Quixote&#8221; and &#8220;A Hero&#8217;s
Life,&#8221; may be imperfect, yet the one critical
fact persists that the executions are remarkably
fine. All things considered, it were perhaps
better that the critical theory under
discussion, if it be accepted at all, be turned
end foremost: that the artist&#8217;s execution of
the task before him be considered either apart
from his aim and point of view, or that it be
considered first, and then&mdash;with not too much
insistence upon them&mdash;his point of view and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
his aim. This would seem to be a more logical
&#230;sthetic and critical order. Tolstoi, with a
sound, intelligent and technically perfect aim
and point of view composed second-rate
drama. So, too, Maeterlinck. Synge, by his
own admissions adjudged critically and dramatically
guilty on both counts, composed one
of the truly first-rate dramas of the Anglo-Saxon
stage.</p>

<p>In its very effort to avoid pigeon-holing,
the Goethe-Carlyle theory pigeon-holes itself.
In its commendable essay at catholicity, it is
like a garter so elastic that it fails to hold itself
up. That there may not be contradictions in
the contentions here set forth, I am not sure.
But I advance no fixed, definite theory of my
own; I advance merely contradictions of certain
of the phases of the theories held by
others, and contradictions are ever in the habit
of begetting contradictions. Yet such contradictions
are in themselves apposite and
soundly critical, since any theory susceptible
of contradictions must itself be contradictory
and insecure. If I suggest any theory on my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
part it is a variable one: a theory that, in this
instance, is one thing and in that, another.
Criticism, as I see it&mdash;and I share the common
opinion&mdash;is simply a sensitive, experienced and
thoroughbred artist&#8217;s effort to interpret, in
terms of &#230;sthetic doctrine and his own peculiar
soul, the work of another artist reciprocally
to that artist and thus, as with a reflecting
mirror, to his public. But to state merely
what criticism is, is not to state the doctrine
of its application. And herein, as I see it, is
where the theorists fail to cover full ground.
The anatomy of criticism is composed not of
one theory, but of a theory&mdash;more or less generally
agreed upon&mdash;upon which are reared in
turn other theories that are not so generally
agreed upon. The Goethe-Carlyle theory is
thus like a three-story building on which the
constructor has left off work after finishing
only the first story. What certain aspects of
these other stories may be like, I have already
tried to suggest.</p>

<p>I have said that, if I have any theory of my
own, it is a theory susceptible in practice of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
numerous surface changes. These surface
changes often disturb in a measure this or that
phase of what lies at the bottom. Thus,
speaking as a critic of the theatre, I find it
impossible to reconcile myself to criticizing
acting and drama from the vantage point of
the same theory, say, for example, the Goethe-Carlyle
theory. This theory fits criticism of
drama much better than it fits criticism of acting,
just as it fits criticism of painting and
sculpture much more snugly than criticism of
music. The means whereby the emotions are
directly affected, and soundly affected, may
at times be critically meretricious, yet the
accomplishment itself may be, paradoxically,
artistic. Perhaps the finest acting performance
of our generation is Bernhardt&#8217;s Camille:
its final effect is tremendous: yet the means
whereby it is contrived are obviously inartistic.
Again, &#8220;King Lear,&#8221; searched into with critical
chill, is artistically a poor instance of play-making,
yet its effect is precisely the effect
striven for. Surely, in cases like these, criticism
founded strictly upon an inflexible theory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
is futile criticism, and not only futile but
eminently unfair.</p>

<p>Here, of course, I exhibit still more contradictions,
but through contradictions we may
conceivably gain more secure ground. When
his book is once opened, the author&#8217;s mouth is
shut. (Wilde, I believe, said that; and though
for some peculiar reason it is today regarded
as suicidal to quote the often profound Wilde
in any serious argument, I risk the danger.)
But when a dramatist&#8217;s play or a composer&#8217;s
symphony is opened, the author has only
begun to open his mouth. What results, an
emotional art within an intellectual art, calls
for a critical theory within a critical theory.
To this composite end, I offer a suggestion:
blend with the Goethe-Carlyle theory that of
the aforementioned Wilde, to wit, that beauty
is uncriticizable, since it has as many meanings
as man has moods, since it is the symbol of
symbols, and since it reveals everything
because it expresses nothing. The trouble
with criticism&mdash;again to pose a contradiction&mdash;is
that, in certain instances, it is often too cerebral.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Feeling a great thrill of beauty, it
turns to its somewhat puzzled mind and is
apprised that the thrill which it has unquestionably
enjoyed from the work of art might
conceivably be of pathological origin, a fremitus
or vibration felt upon percussion of a
hydatoid tumour.</p>

<p>The Goethe-Carlyle theory, properly rigid
and unyielding so far as emotional groundlings
are concerned, may, I believe, at times safely
be chucked under the chin and offered a communication
of gipsy ardour by the critic whose
emotions are the residuum of trial, test and
experience.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Coquelin put it that the footlights exaggerate
everything: they modify the laws of
space and of time; they put miles in a few
square feet; they make minutes appear to be
hours. Of this exaggeration, dramatic criticism&mdash;which
is the branch of criticism of which
I treat in particular&mdash;has caught something.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Of all the branches of criticism it is intrinsically
the least sober and the least accurately
balanced. It always reminds me somehow of
the lash in the hands of &#338;acus, in &#8220;The
Frogs,&#8221; falling upon Bacchus and Xanthus
to discover which of the two is the divine, the
latter meantime endeavouring to conceal the
pain that would betray their mortality by various
transparent dodges. Drama is a two-souled
art: half divine, half clownish. Shakespeare
is the greatest dramatist who ever lived
because he alone, of all dramatists, most accurately
sensed the mongrel nature of his art.
Criticism of drama, it follows, is similarly a
two-souled art: half sober, half mad. Drama
is a deliberate intoxicant; dramatic criticism,
aromatic spirits of ammonia; the re-creation is
never perfect; there is always a trace of tipsiness
left. Even the best dramatic criticism is
always just a little dramatic. It indulges, a
trifle, in acting. It can never be as impersonal,
however much certain of its practitioners may
try, as criticism of painting or of sculpture or
of literature. This is why the best criticism of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the theatre must inevitably be personal criticism.
The theatre itself is distinctly personal;
its address is directly personal. It holds the
mirror not up to nature, but to the spectator&#8217;s
individual idea of nature. If it doesn&#8217;t, it
fails. The spectator, if he is a critic, merely
holds up his own mirror to the drama&#8217;s mirror:
a reflection of the first reflection is the result.
Dramatic criticism is this second reflection.
And so the best dramatic criticism has about
it a flavour of the unconscious, grotesque and
unpremeditated. &#8220;When Lewes was at his
business,&#8221; Shaw has said, &#8220;he seldom remembered
that he was a gentleman or a scholar.&#8221;
(Shaw was speaking of Lewes&#8217; free use of
vulgarity and impudence whenever they happened
to be the proper tools for his job.) &#8220;In
this he showed himself a true craftsman, intent
on making the measurements and analyses
of his criticism as accurate, and their expression
as clear and vivid, as possible, instead
of allowing himself to be distracted by the
vanity of playing the elegant man of letters,
or writing with perfect good taste, or hinting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
in every line that he was above his work. In
exacting all this from himself, and taking his
revenge by expressing his most laboured conclusions
with a levity that gave them the air
of being the unpremeditated whimsicalities of
a man who had perversely taken to writing
about the theatre for the sake of the jest
latent in his own outrageous unfitness for it,
Lewes rolled his stone up the hill quite in the
modern manner of Mr. Walkley, dissembling
its huge weight, and apparently kicking it at
random hither and thither in pure wantonness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Spingarn, in his exceptionally interesting,
if somewhat overly indignant, treatise on
&#8220;Creative Criticism,&#8221; provides, it seems to me,
a particularly clear illustration of the manner
in which the proponents of the more modern
theories of criticism imprison themselves in
the extravagance of their freedom. While
liberating art from all the old rules of criticism,
they simultaneously confine criticism
with the new rules&mdash;or ghosts of rules&mdash;wherewith
they free art. If each work of art is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
unit, a thing in itself, as is commonly agreed,
why should not each work of criticism be
similarly a unit, a thing in itself? If art is,
in each and every case, a matter of individual
expression, why should not criticism, in each
and every such case, be similarly and relevantly
a matter of individual expression? In
freeing art of definitions, has not criticism
been too severely defined? I believe that it
has been. I believe that there may be as many
kinds of criticism as there are kinds of art.
I believe that there may be sound analytical,
sound emotional, sound cerebral, sound impressionistic,
sound destructive, sound constructive,
and other sound species of criticism.
If art knows no rules, criticism knows no
rules&mdash;or, at least, none save those that are
obvious. If Brahms&#8217; scherzo in E flat minor,
op. 4, is an entity, a work in and of itself,
why shouldn&#8217;t Huneker&#8217;s criticism of it be
regarded as an entity, a work in and of itself?
If there is in Huneker&#8217;s work inspiration from
without, so, too, is there in Brahms&#8217;: if Brahms
may be held a unit in this particular instance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
with no consideration of Chopin, why may not
Huneker with no consideration of Brahms?</p>

<p>If this is pushing things pretty far, it is
the Spingarns who have made the pushing necessary.
&#8220;Taste,&#8221; says Mr. Spingarn, &#8220;must
reproduce the work of art within itself in
order to understand and judge it; and at that
moment &#230;sthetic judgment becomes nothing
more or less than creative art itself.&#8221; This
rings true. But granting the perfection of
the taste, why define and limit the critical
creative art thus born of reproduction? No
sooner has a law been enunciated, writes Mr.
Spingarn, than it has been broken by an artist
impatient or ignorant of its restraints, and the
critics have been obliged to explain away these
violations of their laws or gradually to change
the laws themselves. If art, he continues, is
organic expression, and every work of art is
to be interrogated with the question, &#8220;What
has it expressed, and how completely?&#8221;, there
is no place for the question whether it has
conformed to some convenient classification of
critics or to some law derived from this classification.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Once again, truly put. But so,
too, no sooner have laws been enunciated than
they have been broken by critics impatient or
ignorant of their restraints, and the critics of
critics have been obliged to explain away these
violations of the laws, or gradually to change
the laws themselves. And so, too, have these
works of criticism provided no place for the
question whether they have conformed to some
convenient classification of the critics of criticism
or to some law derived from this classification.</p>

<p>&#8220;Criticism,&#8221; said Carlyle, his theories apart,
&#8220;stands like an interpreter between the inspired
and the uninspired, between the prophet
and those who hear the melody of his words,
and catch some glimpse of their material meaning,
but understand not their deeper import.&#8221;
This is the best definition that I know of.
It defines without defining; it gives into the
keeping of the interpreter the hundred languages
of art and merely urges him, with
whatever means may best and properly suit
his ends, to translate them clearly to those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
that do not understand; it sets him free from
the very shackles which Carlyle himself, removing
from art, wound in turn about him.</p>

</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IF the best of criticism, in the familiar
description of Anatole France, lies in
the adventure of a soul among masterpieces,
the best of drama may perhaps be
described as the adventure of a masterpiece
among souls. Drama is fine or impoverished
in the degree that it evokes from such souls a
fitting and noble reaction.</p>

<p>Drama is, in essence, a democratic art in
constant brave conflict with aristocracy of intelligence,
soul and emotion. When drama
triumphs, a masterpiece like &#8220;Hamlet&#8221; comes
to life. When the conflict ends in a draw, a
drama half-way between greatness and littleness
is the result&mdash;a drama, say, such as &#8220;El
Gran Galeoto.&#8221; When the struggle ends in
defeat, the result is a &#8220;Way Down East&#8221; or a
&#8220;Lightnin&#8217;.&#8221; This, obviously, is not to say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
that great drama may not be popular drama,
nor popular drama great drama, for I speak of
drama here not as this play or that, but as a
specific art. And it is as a specific art that it
finds its test and trial, not in its own intrinsically
democratic soul, but in the extrinsic aristocratic
soul that is taste, and connoisseurship,
and final judgment. Drama that has come to
be at once great and popular has ever first been
given the imprimatur, not of democratic souls,
but of aristocratic. Shakespeare and Moli&#232;re
triumphed over aristocracy of intelligence, soul
and emotion before that triumph was presently
carried on into the domain of inferior intelligence,
soul and emotion. In our own day, the
drama of Hauptmann, Shaw and the American
O&#8217;Neill has come into its popular own only
after it first achieved the imprimatur of what
we may term the unpopular, or undemocratic,
theatres. Aristocracy cleared the democratic
path for Ibsen, as it cleared it, in so far as
possible, for Rostand and Hugo von Hofmannsthal.</p>

<p>Great drama is the rainbow born when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
sun of reflection and understanding smiles
anew upon an intelligence and emotion which
that drama has respectively shot with gleams
of brilliant lightning and drenched with the
rain of brilliant tears. Great drama, like
great men and great women, is always just a
little sad. Only idiots may be completely
happy. Reflection, sympathy, wisdom, gallant
gentleness, experience&mdash;the chords upon
which great drama is played&mdash;these are wistful
chords. The commonplace urge that drama,
to be truly great, must uplift is, in the sense
that the word uplift is used, childish. The
mission of great drama is not to make numskulls
glad that they are alive, but to make
them speculate why they are permitted to be
alive at all. And since this is the mission of
great drama&mdash;if its mission may, indeed, be reduced
to any phrase&mdash;it combines within itself,
together with this mystical and awe-struck appeal
to the proletariat, a direct and agreeable
appeal to such persons as are, by reason of
their metaphysical perception and emotional
culture, superior to and contemptuous of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
proletariat. Fine drama, in truth, is usually
just a trifle snobbish. It has no traffic with
such souls as are readily to be made to feel
&#8220;uplifted&#8221; by spurious philosophical nostrums
and emotional sugar pills. Its business is with
what the matchless Dryden hailed &#8220;souls of
the highest rank and truest understanding&#8221;:
souls who find a greater uplift in the noble depressions
of Brahms&#8217; first trio, Bartolommeo&#8217;s
Madonna della Misericordia, and Joseph Conrad&#8217;s
&#8220;Youth&#8221; than in the easy buoyancies of
John Philip Sousa, Howard Chandler Christy
and Rupert Hughes. The aim of great drama
is not to make men happy with themselves as
they are, but with themselves as they might,
yet alas cannot, be. As Gautier has it, &#8220;The
aim of art is not exact reproduction of nature,
but creation, by means of forms and colours, of
a microcosm wherein may be produced dreams,
sensations, and ideas inspired by the aspect of
the world.&#8221; If drama is irrevocably a democratic
art and uplift of the great masses of men
its noblest end, Mrs. Porter&#8217;s &#8220;Pollyanna&#8221;
must endure as a work of dramatic art a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
times finer than Corneille&#8217;s &#8220;Polyeucte.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drama has been strictly defined by the ritualists
in a dozen different ways. &#8220;Drama,&#8221;
says one, &#8220;must be based on character, and the
action proceed from character.&#8221; &#8220;Drama,&#8221;
stipulates another, &#8220;is not an imitation of men,
but of an action and of life: character is subsidiary
to action.&#8221; &#8220;Drama,&#8221; promulgates still
another, &#8220;is the struggle of a will against obstacles.&#8221;
And so on, so on. Rules, rules and
more rules. Pigeon-holes upon pigeon-holes.
Good drama is anything that interests an intelligently
emotional group of persons assembled
together in an illuminated hall. Moli&#232;re,
wise among dramatists, said as much,
though in somewhat more, and doubtless too,
sweeping words. Throughout the ages of
drama there will be always Romanticists of
one sort or another, brave and splendid spirits,
who will have to free themselves from the definitions
and limitations imposed upon them by
the neo-Bossus and Boileaus, and the small
portion Voltaires, La Harpes and Marmontels.
Drama is struggle, a conflict of wills?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Then what of &#8220;Ghosts&#8221;? Drama is action?
Then what of &#8220;Nachtasyl&#8221;? Drama is character?
Then what of &#8220;The Dream Play&#8221;? &#8220;A
&#8216;character&#8217; upon the stage,&#8221; wrote the author
of the last named drama, &#8220;has become a creature
ready-made&mdash;a mere mechanism that
drives the man&mdash;I do not believe in these theatrical
&#8216;characters.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Of all the higher arts, drama is perhaps the
simplest and easiest. Its anatomy is composed
of all the other arts, high and low, stripped
to their elementals. It is a synthesis of
those portions of these other arts that, being
elemental, are most easily assimilable on the
part of the multitude. It is a snatch of music,
a bit of painting, a moment of dancing, a slice
of sculpture, draped upon the skeleton of
literature. At its highest, it ranks with literature,
but never above it. One small notch
below, and it ranks only with itself, in its
own isolated and generically peculiar field.
Drama, indeed, is dancing literature: a hybrid
art. It is often purple and splendid; it is
often profoundly beautiful and profoundly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
moving. Yet, with a direct appeal to the emotions
as its first and encompassing aim, it has
never, even at its finest, been able to exercise
the measure of direct emotional appeal that is
exercised, say, by Chopin&#8217;s C sharp minor
Nocturne, op. 27, No. 1, or by the soft romance
of the canvases of Palma Vecchio, or by
Rodin&#8217;s superb &#8220;Eternal Spring,&#8221; or by Zola&#8217;s
&#8220;La Terre.&#8221; It may, at its finest as at its
worst, of course subjugate and triumph over
inexperienced emotionalism, but the greatest
drama of Shakespeare himself has never, in the
truthful confession of cultivated emotionalism,
influenced that emotionalism as has the
greatest literature, or the greatest music, or
the greatest painting or sculpture. The
splendid music of &#8220;Romeo&#8221; or &#8220;Hamlet&#8221; is
not so eloquent and moving as that of
&#8220;Tristan&#8221; or &#8220;Lohengrin&#8221;; no situation in
the whole of Hauptmann can strike in the
heart so thrilling and profound a chord of pity
as a single line in Allegri&#8217;s obvious &#8220;Miserere.&#8221;
The greatest note of comedy in drama falls
short of the note of comedy in the &#8220;Coffee-Cantata&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of Bach; the greatest note of ironic
remorse falls short of that in the scherzo in B
minor of Chopin; the greatest intellectual note
falls short of that in the first and last movements
of the C minor symphony of Brahms.
What play of Sudermann&#8217;s has the direct appeal
of &#8220;The Indian Lily&#8221;? What play made
out of Hardy&#8217;s &#8220;Tess,&#8221; however adroitly contrived,
retains the powerful appeal of the original
piece of literature? To descend, what
obvious thrill melodrama, designed frankly for
dollars, has&mdash;with all its painstaking and deliberate
intent&mdash;yet succeeded in provoking
half the thrill and shock of the obvious second
chapter of Andreas Latzko&#8217;s equally obvious
&#8220;Men in War&#8221;?</p>

<p>Art is an evocation of beautiful emotions:
art is art in the degree that it succeeds in this
evocation: drama succeeds in an inferior degree.
Whatever emotion drama may succeed
brilliantly in evoking, another art succeeds in
evoking more brilliantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Although, of course, one speaks of drama
here primarily in the sense of acted drama, it
is perhaps not necessary so strictly to confine
one&#8217;s self. For when the critic confines himself
in his discussion of drama to the acted
drama, he regularly brings upon himself from
other critics&mdash;chiefly bookish fellows whose
theatrical knowledge is meagre&mdash;the very
largely unwarranted embarrassment of arguments
anent &#8220;crowd psychology&#8221; and the like
which, while they have little or nothing to do
with the case, none the less make a certain
deep impression upon his readers. (Readers
of criticism become automatically critics; with
his first sentence, the critic challenges his critic-reader&#8217;s
sense of argument.) This constantly
advanced contention of &#8220;crowd psychology,&#8221;
of which drama is supposed to be at once master
and slave, has small place in a consideration
of drama, from whatever sound point of
view one elects to consider the latter. If
&#8220;crowd psychology&#8221; operates in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
theatre drama, it operates also in the case of
concert-hall music. Yet no one so far as I
know seriously maintains that, in a criticism of
music, this &#8220;crowd psychology&#8221; has any place.</p>

<p>I have once before pointed out that, even
accepting the theory of crowd psychology and
its direct and indirect implications so far as
drama is concerned, it is as nonsensical to assume
that one thousand persons assembled together
before a drama in a theatre are, by reason
of their constituting a crowd, any more
likely to be moved automatically than the same
crowd of one thousand persons assembled together
before a painting in an art gallery.
Furthermore, the theory that collective intelligence
and emotionalism are a more facile and
ingenuous intelligence and emotionalism, while
it may hold full water in the psychological
laboratory, holds little in actual external demonstration,
particularly in any consideration
of a crowd before one of the arts. While it
may be true that the Le Bon and Tarde theory
applies aptly to the collective psychology
of a crowd at a prize-fight or a bull-fight or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
a circus, one may be permitted severe doubts
that it holds equally true of a crowd in a
theatre or in an art gallery or in a concert hall.
The tendency of such a latter group is not
&#230;sthetically downward, but upward. And
not only &#230;sthetically, but intellectually and
emotionally. (I speak, of course, and with
proper relevance, of a crowd assembled to hear
good drama or good music, or to see good
painting. The customary obscuring tactic of
critics in this situation is to argue out the principles
of intelligent reaction to good drama in
terms of yokel reaction to bad drama. Analysis
of the principles of sound theatre drama
and the reaction of a group of eight hundred
citizens of Marion, Ohio, to &#8220;The Two Orphans&#8221;
somehow do not seem to me to be
especially apposite.) The fine drama or the
fine piece of music does not make its auditor
part of a crowd; it removes him, and every
one else in the crowd, from the crowd, and
makes him an individual. The crowd ceases
to exist as a crowd; it becomes a crowd of
units, of separate individuals. The dramas of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Mr. Owen Davis make crowds; the dramas
of Shakespeare make individuals.</p>

<p>The argument to the contrary always somewhat
grotesquely assumes that the crowd assembled
at a fine play, and promptly susceptible
to group psychology, is a new crowd,
one that has never attended a fine play before.
Such an assumption falls to pieces in two ways.
Firstly, it is beyond reason to believe that it
is true in more than one instance out of a
hundred; and secondly it would not be true
even if it were true. For, granting that a
crowd of one thousand persons were seeing
great drama for the first time in their lives,
what reason is there for believing that the
majority of persons in the crowd who had
never seen great drama and didn&#8217;t know
exactly what to make of it would be swayed
and influenced by the minority who had never
seen great drama but did know what to make
of it? If this were true, no great drama could
ever possibly fail in the commercial theatre.
Or, to test the hypothesis further, take it the
other way round. What reason is there for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
believing that the majority in this crowd would
be moved the one way or the other, either by
a minority that did understand the play, or did
not understand it? Or take it in another way
still. What reason is there for believing that
the minority in this crowd who did know what
the drama was about would be persuaded
emotionally by the majority who did not know
what the drama was about?</p>

<p>Theories, and again theories. But the facts
fail to support them. Take the lowest type of
crowd imaginable, one in which there is not
one cultured man in a thousand&mdash;the crowd,
say, at a professional American baseball game&mdash;and
pack it into an American equivalent for
Reinhardt&#8217;s Grosses Schauspielhaus. The
play, let us say, is &#8220;&#338;dipus Rex.&#8221; At the
ball game, the crowd psychology of Le Bon
operated to the full. But what now? Would
the crowd, in the theatre and before a great
drama, be the same crowd? Would it not be
an entirely different crowd? Would not its
group psychology promptly and violently suffer
a sudden change? Whether out of curiosity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
disgust, admiration, social shame or what
not, would it not rapidly segregate itself,
spiritually or physically, into various groups?
What is the Le Bon theatrical view of the
crowd psychology that somehow didn&#8217;t come
off during the initial engagement of Barrie&#8217;s
&#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; in Washington, D. C.? Or of
the crowd psychology that worked the other
way round when Ibsen was first played in London?
Or of the crowd psychology that, operating
regularly, if artificially, at the New
York premi&#232;res, most often fails, for all its
high enthusiasm, to move either the minority
or the majority in its composition?</p>

<p>The question of sound drama and the pack
psychology of a congress of groundlings is a
famous one: it gets nowhere. Sound drama
and sound audiences are alone to be considered
at one and the same time. And, as I have
noted, the tendency of willing, or even semi-willing,
auditors and spectators is in an upward
direction, not a downward. No intelligent
spectator at a performance of &#8220;Ben Hur&#8221;
has ever been made to feel like throwing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
hat into the air and cheering by the similar
actions of the mob spectators to the left and
right of him. No ignoble auditor of &#8220;The
Laughter of the Gods&#8221; but has been made to
feel, in some part, the contagion of cultivated
appreciation to <i>his</i> left and right. &#8220;I forget,&#8221;
wrote Sarcey, in a consideration of the subject
of which we have been treating, &#8220;what
tyrant it was of ancient Greece to whom massacres
were every-day affairs, but who wept
copiously over the misfortunes of a heroine in
a tragedy. He was the audience; and for the
one evening clothed himself in the sentiments
of the public.&#8221; A typical example of sophisticated
reasoning. How does Sarcey know
that it was not the rest of the audience&mdash;the
crowd&mdash;that was influenced by this repentant
and copiously lachrymose individual, rather
than that it was this individual who was moved
by the crowd?</p>

<p>If fallacies perchance insinuate themselves
into these opposing contentions, it is a case of
fallacy versus fallacy: my intent is not so much
to prove anything as to indicate the presence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
of holes in the proofs of the other side. These
holes seem to me to be numerous, and of considerable
circumference. A description of two
of them may suffice to suggest the rest. Take,
as the first of these, the familiar Castelvetro
doctrine that, since a theatrical audience is not
a select congress but a motley crowd, the dramatist,
ever conscious of the group psychology,
must inevitably avoid all themes and ideas unintelligible
to such a gathering. It may be
true that a theatrical audience is not a select
congress, but why confine the argument to
theatrical audiences and seek thus to prove
something of drama that may be proved as
well&mdash;if one is given to such idiosyncrasies&mdash;of
music? What, as I have said before, of
opera and concert hall audiences? Consider
the average audience at Covent Garden, the
Metropolitan, Carnegie Hall. Is it any way
culturally superior to the average audience at
the St. James&#8217;s Theatre, or the Th&#233;&#226;tre de
l&#8217;Oeuvre, or the Plymouth&mdash;or even the Neighbourhood
Playhouse down in Grand Street?
What of the audiences who attended the original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
performances of Beethoven&#8217;s &#8220;Leonore&#8221;
(&#8220;Fidelio&#8221;), Berlioz&#8217;s &#8220;Benvenuto Cellini,&#8221;
the original performances of Wagner in
France and the performances of his &#8220;Der Fliegende
Holl&#228;nder&#8221; in Germany, the operas of
H&#228;ndel in England in the years 1733-37, the
work of Rossini in Italy, the concerts of
Chopin during his tour of England and Scotland?...
Again, as to the imperative necessity
of the dramatist&#8217;s avoidance of all
themes and ideas unintelligible to a mob audience,
what of the success among such very
audiences of&mdash;to name but a few more recent
profitably produced and locally readily recognizable
examples&mdash;Shaw&#8217;s &#8220;Getting Married,&#8221;
Augustus Thomas&#8217; &#8220;The Witching
Hour,&#8221; Ibsen&#8217;s &#8220;The Wild Duck,&#8221; Dunsany&#8217;s
&#8220;The Laughter of the Gods,&#8221; Barrie&#8217;s &#8220;Mary
Rose,&#8221; Strindberg&#8217;s &#8220;The Father,&#8221; Synge&#8217;s
&#8220;Playboy&#8221;?... Surely it will be quickly
allowed that however obvious the themes and
ideas of these plays may be to the few, they
are hardly within the ready intelligence of
what the theorists picture as the imaginary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
mob theatre audience. Fine drama is independent
of all such theories: the dramatist
who subscribes to them should not figure in any
treatise upon drama as an art.</p>

<p>A second illustration: the equivocation to
the effect that drama, being a democratic art,
may not properly be evaluated in terms of
more limited, and aristocratic, taste. It seems
to me, at least, an idiotic assumption that
drama is a more democratic art than music.
All great art is democratic in intention, if
not in reward. Michelangelo, Shakespeare,
Wagner and Zola are democratic artists, and
their art democratic art. It is criticism of
Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Wagner and Zola
that is aristocratic. Criticism, not art, generically
wears the ermine and the purple. To
appraise a democratic art in terms of democracy
is to attempt to effect a chemical reaction
in nitrogen with nitrogen. If drama is,
critically, a democratic art since it is meant
not to be read by the few but to be played before
the many, music must be critically no less
a democratic art. Yet the theorists conveniently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
overlook this embarrassment. Nevertheless,
if Shakespeare&#8217;s dramas were designed
for the heterogeneous ear, so, too, were the
songs of Schumann. No great artist has ever
in his heart deliberately fashioned his work for
a remote and forgotten cellar, dark and stairless.
He fashions it, for all his doubts, in the
hope of hospitable eyes and ears, and in the
hope of a sun to shine upon it. It is as ridiculous
to argue that because Shakespeare&#8217;s is
a democratic art it must be criticized in terms
of democratic reaction to it as it would be to argue
that because the United States is a democracy
the most acute and comprehensive criticism
of that democracy must lie in a native
democrat&#8217;s reaction to it. &#8220;To say that the
theatre is for the people,&#8221; says Gordon Craig,
&#8220;is necessary. But to forget to add that part
and parcel of the people is the aristocracy,
whether of birth or feeling, is an omission. A
man of the eighteenth century, dressed in silks,
in a fashionable loggia in the theatre at Versailles,
looking as if he did no work (as Voltaire
in his youth may have looked), presents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
in essence, exactly the same picture as Walt
Whitman in his rough gray suit lounging in
the Bowery, also looking as if he did no work....
One the aristocrat, one the democrat: the
two are identical.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>&#8220;Convictions,&#8221; said Nietzsche, &#8220;are prisons.&#8221;
Critical &#8220;theories,&#8221; with negligible exception,
seek to denude the arts of their splendid, gipsy
gauds and to force them instead to don so
many duplicated black and white striped uniforms.
Of all the arts, drama has suffered
most in this regard. Its critics, from the time
of Aristotle, have bound and fettered it, and
have then urged it impassionedly to soar.
Yet, despite its shackles, it has triumphed, and
each triumph has been a derision of one of its
most famous and distinguished critics. It
triumphed, through Shakespeare, over Aristotle;
it triumphed, through Moli&#232;re, over Castelvetro;
it triumphed, through Lemercier,
over Diderot; it triumphed, through Lessing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
over Voltaire; it triumphed, through Ibsen,
over Flaubert; it has triumphed, through
Hauptmann, over Sarcey and, through
Schnitzler and Bernard Shaw, over Mr.
Archer. The truth perhaps is that drama is
an art as flexible as the imaginations of its
audiences. It is no more to be bound by rules
and theories than such imaginations are to be
bound by rules and theories. Who so all-wise
that he may say by what rules or set of
rules living imaginations and imaginations yet
unborn are to be fanned into theatrical flame?
&#8220;Imagination,&#8221; Samuel Johnson&#8217;s words apply
to auditor as to artist, &#8220;a licentious and vagrant
faculty, unsusceptible of limitations and
impatient of restraint, has always endeavoured
to baffle the logician, to perplex the
confines of distinction, and burst the inclosures
of regularity.&#8221; And further, &#8220;There is therefore
scarcely any species of writing of which
we can tell what is its essence, and what are
its constituents; every new genius produces
some innovation which, when invented and
approved, subverts the rules which the practice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of foregoing authors had established.&#8221;</p>

<p>Does the play interest, and whom? This
seems to me to be the only doctrine of dramatic
criticism that is capable of supporting itself
soundly. First, does the play interest? In
other words, how far has the dramatist succeeded
in expressing himself, and the materials
before him, intelligently, eloquently, symmetrically,
beautifully? So much for the criticism
of the dramatist as an artist. In the
second place, whom does the play interest?
Does it interest inferior persons, or does it
interest cultivated and artistically sensitive
persons? So much for the criticism of the
artist as a dramatist.</p>

<p>The major difficulty with critics of the
drama has always been that, having once positively
enunciated their critical credos, they
have been constrained to devote their entire
subsequent enterprise and ingenuity to defending
the fallacies therein. Since a considerable
number of these critics have been, and are,
extraordinarily shrewd and ingenious men,
these defences of error have often been contrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
with such persuasive dexterity and reasonableness
that they have endured beyond the
more sound doctrines of less deft critics, doctrines
which, being sound, have suffered the
rebuffs that gaunt, grim logic, ever unprepossessing
and unhypnotic, suffers always. &#8220;I
hope that I am right; if I am not right, I am
still right,&#8221; said Bruneti&#232;re. &#8220;Mr. William
Archer is not only, like myself, a convinced,
inflexible determinist,&#8221; Henry Arthur Jones
has written, &#8220;I am persuaded that he is also,
unlike myself, a consistent one. I am sure he
takes care that his practice agrees with his
opinions&mdash;even when they are wrong.&#8221; Dramatic
criticism is an attempt to formulate rules
of conduct for the lovable, wayward, charming,
wilful vagabond that is the drama. For the
drama is an art with a feather in its cap and
an ironic smile upon its lips, sauntering impudently
over forbidden lawns and through
closed lanes into the hearts of those of us
children of the world who have never grown
up. Beside literature, it is the Mother Goose
of the arts: a gorgeous and empurpled Mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
Goose for the fireside of impressible and romantic
youth that, looking upward, leans ever
hushed and expectant at the knee of life. It
is a fairy tale told realistically, a true story
told as romance. It is the lullaby of disillusion,
the chimes without the cathedral, the
fears and hopes and dreams and passions of
those who cannot fully fear and hope and
dream and flame of themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;The drama must have reality,&#8221; so Mr. P.
P. Howe in his engaging volume of &#8220;Dramatic
Portraits,&#8221; &#8220;but the first essential to our
understanding of an art is that we should not
believe it to be actual life. The spectator who
shouts his warning and advice to the heroine
when the villain is approaching is, in the theatre,
the only true believer in the hand of God;
and he is liable to find it in a drama lower than
the best.&#8221; The art of the drama is one which
imposes upon drama the obligation of depicting
at once the inner processes of life realistically,
and the external aspects of life delusively.
Properly and sympathetically to appreciate
drama, one must look upon it synchronously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
with two different eyes: the one arguing
against the other as to the truth of what it
sees, and triumphing over this doubtful other
with the full force of its sophistry. Again inevitably
to quote Coleridge, &#8220;Stage presentations
are to produce a sort of temporary half-faith,
which the spectator encourages in himself
and supports by a voluntary contribution
on his own part, because he knows that it is
at all times in his power to see the thing as it
really is. Thus the true stage illusion as to a
forest scene consists, not in the mind&#8217;s judging
it to be a forest, but in its remission of the
judgment that it is not a forest.&#8221; This obviously
applies to drama as well as to dramatic
investiture. One never for a moment
believes absolutely that Mr. John Barrymore
is Richard III; one merely agrees, for the
sake of Shakespeare, who has written the play,
and Mr. Hopkins, who has cast it, that Mr.
John Barrymore is Richard III, that one may
receive the ocular, aural and mental sensations
for which one has paid three dollars and
a half. Nor does one for a moment believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
that Mr. Walter Hampden, whom that very
evening one has seen dividing a brobdingnagian
dish of goulash with Mr. Oliver Herford
in the Player&#8217;s Club and discussing the prospects
of the White Sox, is actually speaking
extemporaneously the rare verbal embroideries
of Shakespeare; or that Miss Ethel Barrymore
who is billed in front of Browne&#8217;s Chop
House to take a star part in the Actors&#8217;
Equity Association&#8217;s benefit, is really the
queen of a distant kingdom.</p>

<p>The dramatist, in the theatre, is not a
worker in actualities, but in the essence of actualities
that filters through the self-deception
of his spectators. There is no such thing
as realism in the theatre: there is only mimicry
of realism. There is no such thing as
romance in the theatre: there is only mimicry
of romance. There is no such thing as
an automatic dramatic susceptibility in a theatre
audience: there is only a volitional dramatic
susceptibility. Thus, it is absurd to
speak of the drama holding the mirror up to
nature; all that the drama can do is to hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
nature up to its own peculiar mirror which,
like that in a pleasure-park carousel, amusingly
fattens up nature, or shrinks it, yet does
not at any time render it unrecognizable.
One does not go to the theatre to see life and
nature; one goes to see the particular way in
which life and nature happen to look to a cultivated,
imaginative and entertaining man
who happens, in turn, to be a playwright.
Drama is the surprising pulling of a perfectly
obvious, every-day rabbit out of a perfectly
obvious, every-day silk hat. The spectator has
seen thousands of rabbits and thousands of
silk hats, but he has never seen a silk hat that
had a rabbit concealed in it, and he is curious
about it.</p>

<p>But if drama is essentially mimetic, so also&mdash;as
Professor Gilbert Murray implies&mdash;is
criticism essentially mimetic in that it is representative
of the work criticized. It is conceivable
that one may criticize Mr. Ziegfeld&#8217;s
&#8220;Follies&#8221; in terms of the &#8220;Philoctetes&#8221; of
Theodectes&mdash;I myself have been guilty of
even more exceptional feats; it is not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
conceivable, but of common occurrence, for
certain of our academic American critics to
criticize the plays of Mr. Shaw in terms of
Scribe and Sardou, and with a perfectly
straight face; but criticism in general is a
chameleon that takes on something of the
colour of the pattern upon which it imposes
itself. There is drama in Horace&#8217;s &#8220;Epistola
ad Pisones,&#8221; a criticism of drama. There
is the spirit of comedy in Hazlitt&#8217;s essay &#8220;On
the Comic Writers of the Last Century.&#8221;
Dryden&#8217;s &#8220;Essay on Dramatic Poesy&#8221; is
poetry. There is something of the music
of Chopin in Huneker&#8217;s critical essays on
Chopin, and some of Mary Garden&#8217;s spectacular
histrionism in his essay on her acting.
Walkley, criticizing &#8220;L&#8217;Enfant Prodigue,&#8221;
uses the pen of Pierrot. Criticism, more than
drama with her mirror toward nature, holds
the mirror up to the nature of the work it
criticizes. Its end is the revivification of the
passion of art which has been spent in its behalf,
but under the terms laid down by Plato.
Its aim is to reconstruct a great work of art<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
on a diminutive scale, that eyes which are not
capable of gazing on high may have it within
the reach of their vision. Its aim is to play
again all the full richness of the artist&#8217;s emotional
organ tones, in so far as is possible, on
the cold cerebral xylophone that is criticism&#8217;s
deficient instrument. In the accomplishment
of these aims, it is bound by no laws that art
is not bound by. There is but one rule: there
are no rules. Art laughs at locksmiths.</p>

<p>It has been a favourite diversion of critics
since Aristotle&#8217;s day to argue that drama is
drama, whether one reads it from a printed
page or sees it enacted in a theatre. Great
drama, they announce, is great drama whether
it ever be acted or not; &#8220;it speaks with the
same voice in solitude as in crowds&#8221;; and &#8220;all
the more then&#8221;&mdash;again I quote Mr. Spingarn&mdash;&#8220;will
the drama itself &#8216;even apart from representation
and actors,&#8217; as old Aristotle puts
it, speak with its highest power to the imagination
fitted to understand and receive
it.&#8221; Upon this point of view much of the
academic criticism of drama has been based.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
But may we not well reply that, for all
the fact that Shakespeare would still be the
greatest dramatist who ever lived had he
never been played in the theatre, so, too,
would Bach still be the greatest composer who
ever lived had his compositions never been
played at all? If drama is not meant for actors,
may we not also argue that music is not
meant for instruments? Are not such expedients
less sound criticism than clever evasion
of sound criticism: a frolicsome and agreeable
straddling of the &#230;sthetic see-saw? There is
the printed drama&mdash;criticize it. There is the
same drama acted&mdash;criticize it. Why quibble?
Sometimes, as in the case of &#8220;Gioconda&#8221;
and Duse, they are one. Well and
good. Sometimes, as in the case of &#8220;Chantecler&#8221;
and Maude Adams, they are not one.
Well and good. But where, in either case,
the confusion that the critics lay such stress
upon? These critics deal not with theories,
but with mere words. They take two dozen
empty words and adroitly seek therewith to
fashion a fecund theory. The result is&mdash;words.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
&#8220;Words which,&#8221; said Ruskin, &#8220;if
they are not watched, will do deadly work
sometimes. There are masked words droning
and skulking about us just now ... (there
never were so many, owing to the teaching
of catechisms and phrases at school instead of
human meanings) ... there never were creatures
of prey so mischievous, never diplomatists
so cunning, never poisoners so deadly,
as these masked words: they are the unjust
stewards of men&#8217;s ideas....&#8221;</p>

</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE theatre stands in relation to drama
much as the art gallery stands in relation
to painting. Its aim is to set off
drama in such surroundings and in such light
as to bring it within the comfortable vision and
agreeable scrutiny of the nomad public. To
say that fine drama may produce an equal effect
read as acted may be true or not as you
choose, but so too a fine painting may produce
an equal effect beheld in one&#8217;s library as in
the Uffizi. Art thrives&mdash;art leads to art&mdash;on
sympathy and a measure of general understanding.
Otherwise, of what use criticism?
To divorce the theatre from a consideration
of drama as an art, to contend, as it has been
contended from Aristotle&#8217;s day to Corneille&#8217;s,
and from Dryden&#8217;s and Lamb&#8217;s to our own,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
that &#8220;the more lasting and noble design&#8221; of
drama rests in a reading rather than a seeing,
may be, strictly, a logical &#230;sthetic man&#339;uvre,
but equally a logical &#230;sthetic man&#339;uvre
would be a divorcement of canvas from painting
as an art. The theatre is the canvas of
drama. The printed drama is like a bubbling
and sunlit spring, encountered only by wanderers
into the hills and awaiting the bottling
process of the theatre to carry its tonic waters
far and wide among an expectant and emotionally
ill people.</p>

<p>The criticism that nominates itself to hold
drama and the theatre as things apart is a
criticism which, for all its probable integrity
and reason, suffers from an excessive aristocracy,
like a duchess in a play by Mr. Sydney
Grundy. Its &#230;sthetic nose is elevated to such
a degree that it may no longer serve as a practical
organ of earthly smell, but merely as a
quasi-wax feature to round out the symmetry
of the face. It is criticism in a stiff corset,
erect, immobile, lordly&mdash;like the Prussian lieutenant
of yesterday, a striking figure, yet just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
a little absurd. It is sound, but like many
things that are sound in &#230;sthetics, it has its
weak points, even its confounding points. For
they say that propaganda can have no place in
art, and along comes a Hauptmann and writes
a &#8220;Weavers.&#8221; Or they say that art is form,
and along comes a Richard Strauss and composes
two songs for baritone and orchestra
that set the critics to a mad chasing of their
own tails. Or, opposing criticism as an art,
they say that &#8220;criticism is art in form, but its
content is judgment, which takes it out of the
intuitional world into the conceptual world&#8221;&mdash;and
along comes an H. G. Wells with his
&#8220;The New Machiavelli&#8221; which, like criticism,
is art in form and its content judgment. To
hold that the drama as an art may achieve its
highest end read by the individual and not
acted in the theatre, is to hold that music as
an art may achieve its highest end played by
but one instrument and not by an orchestra.
The theatre is the drama&#8217;s orchestra: upon the
wood of its boards and the wind of its puppets
is the melody of drama in all its full richness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
sounded. What if drama is art and the
theatre not art? What if &#8220;Hamlet&#8221; is art
and electric lights and cheese-cloth are not
art? Schubert&#8217;s piano trio, op. 99, is art, and
a pianoforte is a mere wooden box containing
a number of little hammers that hit an equal
number of steel and copper wires. What if
I can read a full imagination into &#8220;Romeo and
Juliet&#8221; and thus people it and make it live for
me, without going to the theatre? So, too,
can I read a full melody into the manuscript of
a song by Hugo Wolf and thus make it sing
for me, without going to a concert hall. But
why? Is there only one way to appreciate
and enjoy art&mdash;and since when? Wagner on
a single violin is Wagner; Wagner on all the
orchestra is super-Wagner. To read a great
drama is to play &#8220;Parsifal&#8221; on a cornet and
an oboe.</p>

<p>The object of the theatre is not, as is habitually
maintained, a shrewd excitation of the
imagination of a crowd, but rather a shrewd
relaxation of that imagination. It is a faulty
axiom that holds the greatest actor in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
theatre to be an audience&#8217;s imagination, and
the adroit cultivation of the latter to be ever
productive of large financial return. As I
have on more than one occasion pointed out
from available and acutely relevant statistics,
the more a dramatist relies upon the imagination,
of an audience, the less the box-office
reward that is his. An audience fills a theatre
auditorium not so eager to perform with its
imagination as to have its imagination performed
upon. This is not the paradox it may
superficially seem to be. The difference is
the difference between a prompt commercial
failure like Molnar&#8217;s &#8220;Der Gardeofficier&#8221;
(&#8220;Where Ignorance Is Bliss&#8221;) which asks an
audience to perform with its imagination and
a great commercial success like Barrie&#8217;s
&#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; which performs upon the audience&#8217;s
imagination by supplying to it every
detail of imagination, ready-made and persuasively
labelled. The theatre is not a place to
which one goes in search of the unexplored
corners of one&#8217;s imagination; it is a place to
which one goes in repeated search of the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
corners of one&#8217;s imagination. The moment
the dramatist works in the direction of
unfamiliar corners, he is lost. This, contradictorily
enough, is granted by the very critics
who hold to the imagination fallacy which I
have just described. They unanimously agree
that a dramatist&#8217;s most successful cultivation
of an audience lies in what they term, and
nicely, the mood of recognition, and in the
same breath paradoxically contend that sudden
imaginative shock is a desideratum no less.</p>

<p>In this pleasant remission of the active imagination
lies one of the secrets of the charm
of the theatre. Nor is the theatre alone in
this. On even the higher plane of the authentic
arts a measure of the same phenomenon
assists in what may perhaps not too far-fetchedly
be termed the negative stimulation of the
spectator&#8217;s fancy. For all the pretty and
winning words to the contrary, no person capable
of sound introspection will admit that a
beautiful painting like Giorgione&#8217;s &#8220;The Concert&#8221;
or a beautiful piece of sculpture like
Pisano&#8217;s Perugian fountain actually and literally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
stirs his imagination, and sets it a-sail
across hitherto uncharted &#230;sthetic seas. What
such a painting or piece of sculpture does is to
reach out and, with its overpowering beauty,
encompass and &#230;sthetically fence in the antecedent
wandering and uncertain imagination
of its spectator. As in the instance of drama,
it does not so much awaken a dormant imagination
as soothe an imagination already awake.
Of all the arts, music alone remains a telegrapher
of unborn dreams.</p>

<p>The theatre brings to the art of drama concrete
movement, concrete colour, and concrete
final effectiveness: this, in all save a few minor
particulars. The art of drama suffers, true
enough, when the theatre, even at its finest,
is challenged by it to produce the values intrinsic
in its ghost of a dead king, or in its battle
on Bosworth Field, or in its ship torn by the
tempest, or in its fairy wood on midsummer
night, or in its approaching tread of doom of
the gods of the mountain. But for each such
defeat it prospers doubly in the gifts that the
theatre brings to it. Such gifts as the leader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Craig has brought to the furtherance of the
beauty of &#8220;Electra&#8221; and &#8220;Hamlet,&#8221; as Reinhardt
and his aides have brought to &#8220;Ariadne&#8221;
and &#8220;Julius C&#230;sar,&#8221; as Golovine and Appia
and Bakst and Linnebach and half a dozen
others have brought to the classics that have
called to them, are not small ones. They have
crystallized the glory of drama, have taken so
many loose jewels and given them substantial
and appropriate settings which have fittingly
posed their radiance. To say that the reading
imagination of the average cultured man is
superior in power of suggestion and depiction
to the imagination of the theatre is idiotically
to say that the reading imagination of every
average cultured man is superior in these powers
to the combined theatrical imaginations of
Gordon Craig, Max Reinhardt and Eleanora
Duse operating jointly upon the same play.
Even a commonplace imagination can successfully
conjure up a landscape more beautiful
than any painted by Poussin or Gainsborough,
or jewels more opalescent than any painted by
Rembrandt, or a woman&#8217;s dress more luminous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
than any painted by Fortuny, or nymphs
more beguiling than any of Rubens&#8217;, yet who
so foolish to say&mdash;as they are wont foolishly to
say of reading imagination and the drama&mdash;that
such an imagination is therefore superior
to that of the artists? This, in essence, is
none the less the serious contention of those
who decline to reconcile themselves to the
theatrically produced drama. This contention,
reduced to its skeleton, is that, since the
vice-president of the Corn Exchange Bank
can picture the chamber in the outbuilding adjoining
Gloster&#8217;s castle more greatly to his
satisfaction than Adolphe Appia can picture
it for him on the stage, the mental performance
of the former is therefore a finer artistic
achievement than the stage performance of
the latter.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The word imagination leads critics to queer
antics. It is, perhaps, the most manhandled
word in our critical vocabulary. It is used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
almost invariably in its literal meaning: no
shades and shadows are vouchsafed to it.
Imagination, in good truth, is not the basis of
art, but an overtone. Many an inferior artist
has a greater imagination than many a superior
artist. Maeterlinck&#8217;s imagination is much
richer than Hauptmann&#8217;s, Erik Satie&#8217;s is
much richer than C&#233;sar Franck&#8217;s, and I am
not at all certain that Romain Rolland&#8217;s is not
twice as opulent as Thomas Hardy&#8217;s. Imagination
is the slave of the true artist, the master
of the weak. The true artist beats imagination
with the cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails of his individual
technic until it cries out in pain, and this pain
is the work of art which is born. The inferior
craftsman comfortably confounds imagination
with the finished work, and so pets and
coddles it; and imagination&#8217;s resultant mincings
and giggles he then vaingloriously sets
forth as resolute art.</p>

<p>The theatre offers to supplement, embroider
and enrich the imagination of the reader of
drama with the imaginations of the actor, the
scene designer, the musician, the costumer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
the producing director. Each of these, before
he sets himself to his concrete task, has&mdash;like
the lay reader&mdash;sought the fruits of his own
reading imagination. The fruits of these five
reading imaginations are then assembled,
carefully assorted, and the most worthy of
them deftly burbanked. The final staging of
the drama is merely a staging of these best
fruits of the various reading imaginations.
To say, against this, that it is most often impossible
to render a reading imagination into
satisfactory concrete forms is doubtless to say
what is, strictly, true. But art itself is at its
highest merely an approach toward limitless
imagination and beauty. &#198;sthetics is a pilgrim
on the road to a Mecca that is ever just
over the sky-line. Of how many great works
of art can one say, with complete and final
conviction, that art in this particular direction
can conceivably go no farther? Is it not
conceivable that some super-Michelangelo
will some day fashion an even more perfect
&#8220;Slave,&#8221; and some super-Shakespeare an even
more beautiful poetic drama?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>The detractors of the theatre are often expert
in persuasive half-truths and masters of
dialectic sleight-of-hand. Their performances
are often so adroit that the spectator is
quick to believe that the trunk is really empty,
yet the false bottom is there for all its cunning
concealment. Take, for example, George
Moore, in the preface to his last play, &#8220;The
Coming of Gabrielle.&#8221; &#8220;The illusion created
by externals, scenes, costumes, lighting and
short sentences is in itself illusory,&#8221; he professes
to believe, though why he numbers the
dramatist&#8217;s short sentences among the externals
of the stage is not quite clear. &#8220;The best
performances of plays and operas are witnessed
at rehearsals. Jean de Reszke was
never so like Tristan at night as he was in the
afternoon when he sang the part in a short
jacket, a bowler hat and an umbrella in his
hand. The chain armour and the plumes that
he wore at night were but a distraction, setting
our thoughts on periods, on the short swords
in use in the ninth century in Ireland or in
Cornwall, on the comfort or the discomfort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the ships in which the lovers were voyaging,
on the absurd night-dress which is the convention
that Isolde should appear in, a garment
she never wore and which we know to be make-believe.
But the hat and feathers that Isolde
appears in when she rehearses the part are
forgotten the moment she sings; and if I had
to choose to see Forbes-Robertson play Hamlet
or rehearse Hamlet, I should not hesitate
for a moment. The moment he speaks he
ceases to be a modern man, but in black hose
the illusion ceases, for we forget the Prince
of Denmark and remember the mummer.&#8221;
Years ago, in a volume of critical essays given
the title &#8220;Another Book on the Theatre,&#8221; I
took a boyish delight in setting off precisely
the same noisy firework just to hear the folks
in the piazza rocking-chairs let out a yell.
These half-truths serve criticism as sauce
serves asparagus: they give tang to what is
otherwise often tasteless food. This is particularly
true with criticism at its most geometrical
and profound, since such criticism, save
in rare instances, is not especially lively reading.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
But, nevertheless, the sauce is not the
asparagus. And when Mr. Moore (doubtless
with his tongue in his cheek) observes that
he can much more readily imagine the lusty
Frau Tillie Pfirsich-Melba as Isolde in a pink
and green ostrich feather hat confected in
some Friedrichstrasse atelier than in the customary
stage trappings, he allows, by implication,
that he might even more readily imagine
the elephantine lady as the seductive Carmen
if she had no clothes on at all.</p>

<p>This is the trouble with paradoxes. It is
not that they prove too little, as is believed
of them, but that they prove altogether too
much. If the illusion created by stage externals
is in itself illusory, as Mr. Moore says, the
complete deletion of all such stage externals
should be the best means for providing absolute
illusion. Yet the complete absence of illusion
where this is the case is all too familiar
to any of us who have looked on such spectacles
as &#8220;The Bath of Phryne&#8221; and the like in
the theatres of Paris. A prodigality of stage
externals does not contribute to disillusion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
but to illusion. These externals have become,
through protracted usage, so familiar that
they are, so to speak, scarcely seen: they are
taken by the eye for granted. By way of
proof, one need only consider two types of
Shakespearian production, one like that of
Mr. Robert Mantell and one like that lately
employed for &#8220;Macbeth&#8221; by Mr. Arthur
Hopkins. Where the overladen stereotyped
first production paradoxically fades out of the
picture for the spectator and leaves the path
of illusion clear for him, the superlatively
simple second production, almost wholly
bereft of familiar externals, arrests and fixes
his attention and makes illusion impossible.
It is true, of course, that all this may be
changed in time, when the deletion of externals
by the new stagecraft shall have become
a convention of the theatre as the heavy laying-on
of externals is a convention at present.
But, as things are today, these externals are,
negatively, the most positive contributors to
illusion.</p>

<p>It is the misfortune of the theatre that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
critics have almost always approached it, and
entered it, with a defiant and challenging air.
I have, during the eighteen years of my active
critical service, met with and come to know at
least fifty professional critics in America, in
England and on the Continent, and among all
this number there have been but four who have
approached the theatre enthusiastically prejudiced
in its favour&mdash;two of them asses.
But between the one large group that has been
critically hostile and the other smaller group
that has been uncritically effervescent, I have
encountered no sign of calm and reasoned
compromise, no sign of frank and intelligent
willingness to regard each and every theatre
as a unit, and so to be appraised, instead of
lumping together good and bad theatres alike
and labelling the heterogeneous mass &#8220;the
theatre.&#8221; There is no such thing as &#8220;the
theatre.&#8221; There is this theatre, that theatre,
and still that other theatre. Each is a unit.
To talk of &#8220;the theatre&#8221; is to talk of the Greek
theatre, the Elizabethan theatre and the modern
theatre in one breath, or to speak simultaneously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
of the Grosses Schauspielhaus of
Max Reinhardt and the Eltinge Theatre of
Mr. A. H. Woods. &#8220;The theatre,&#8221; of course,
has certain more or less minor constant and
enduring conventions&mdash;at least, so it seems as
far as we now can tell&mdash;but so, too, has chirography,
yet we do not speak of &#8220;the chirography.&#8221;
There are some theatres&mdash;I use the
word in its proper restricted sense&mdash;that
glorify drama and enhance its beauty; there
are others that vitiate drama. But so also are
there some men who write fine drama, and
others who debase drama to mere fodder for
witlings.... The Shakespeare of the theatre
of Gordon Craig is vivid and brilliant beauty.
Call it art or not art as you will&mdash;what does a
label matter? The Moli&#232;re of the theatre of
Alexander Golovine is suggestive and exquisite
enchantment. Call it art or not art as
you will&mdash;what does a label matter? The
Wagner of the opera house of Ludwig Sievert
is triumphant and rapturous splendour. Call
it anything you like&mdash;and again, what does a
label matter? There are too many labels in
the world.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WHEN Mr. Nathan says that acting
is not an art, of course he is talking
arrant rot&mdash;who could doubt it,
after witnessing a performance by the great
Duse?&#8221; So, the estimable actor, Mr. Arnold
Daly. Whether acting is or is not an art, it
is not my concern at the moment to consider,
yet I quote the <i>riposte</i> of Mr. Daly as perhaps
typical of those who set themselves as defenders
of the yea theory. It seems to me that
if this is a satisfactory <i>touche</i> no less satisfactory
should be some such like rejoinder as:
&#8220;When Mr. Nathan says that acting <i>is</i> an art,
of course he is talking arrant rot&mdash;who could
doubt it, after witnessing a performance by
Mr. Corse Payton.&#8221;</p>

<p>If an authentic art is anything which may
properly be founded upon an exceptionally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
brilliant performance, then, by virtue of the
Reverend Doctor Ernest M. Stires&#8217; brilliant
performance in it, is pulpiteering an art, and,
on the strength of Miss Bird Millman&#8217;s brilliant
performance in it, is tight-rope walking
an art no less. Superficially a mere dialectic
monkey-trick, this is yet perhaps not so absurd
as it may seem, for if Duse&#8217;s art lies in the
fact that she breathes life and dynamic effect
into the written word of the artist D&#8217;Annunzio,
Stires&#8217; lies in the more substantial fact
that he breathes life and dynamic effect into
the word of the somewhat greater, and more
evasive artist, God. And Miss Millman, too,
brings to her quasi-art, movement, colour,
rhythm, beauty and&mdash;one may even say&mdash;a
sense of fantastic character, since the effect
she contrives is less that of a dumpy little
woman in a short white skirt pirouetting on a
taut wire than of an unreal creature, half bird,
half woman, out of some forgotten fable.</p>

<p>The circumstance that Duse is an artist
who happens to be an actress does not make
acting an art any more than the circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
that Villon was an artist who happened to be
a burglar or that Paderewski is an artist who
happens to be a politician makes burglary and
politics arts. Duse is an artist first, and an
actress second: one need only look into her
very great share in the creation of the dramas
bearing the name of D&#8217;Annunzio to reconcile
one&#8217;s self&mdash;if not too stubborn, at least in part&mdash;to
this point of view. So, also, were
Clairon, Rachel and Jane Hading artists
apart from histrionism, and so too, is Sarah
Bernhardt: who can fail to detect the creative
artist in the &#8220;M&#233;moires&#8221; of the first named, for
instance, or, in the case of the last named, in
the fertile impulses of her essays in sculpture,
painting and dramatic literature? It is a curious
thing that, in all the pronouncements of
acting as an art, the names chosen by the advocates
as representative carriers of the &#230;sthetic
banner are those of actors and actresses who
have most often offered evidence of artistic
passion in fields separate and apart from their
histrionic endeavours. Lema&#238;tre, Salvini,
Rachel, Talma, Coquelin, Betterton, Garrick,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
Fanny Kemble, the Bancrofts, Irving, Tree,
and on down&mdash;far down&mdash;the line to Ditrichstein,
Sothern, Marie Tempest, Guitry,
Gemier and the brothers Barrymore&mdash;all give
testimony, in writing, painting, musicianship,
poetry and dramatic authorship to &#230;sthetic
impulses other than acting. Since acting
itself as an art is open to question, the merit or
demerit of the performances produced from
the &#230;sthetic impulses in point is not an issue:
the fact seems to be that it has been the artist
who has become the actor rather than the actor
who has become the artist.</p>

<p>The actor, as I have on another occasion
hazarded, is the child of the miscegenation of
an art and a trade: of the drama and the
theatre. Since acting must appeal to the
many&mdash;this is obviously its only reason for being,
for acting is primarily a filter through
which drama may be lucidly distilled for
heterogeneous theatre-goers&mdash;it must, logically,
be popular or perish. Surely no authentic
art can rest or thrive upon such a premise.
The great actors and actresses, unlike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
great fashioners in other arts, have invariably
been favourites of the crowd, and it is doubtless
a too charitable hypothesis to assume that
this crowd has ever been gifted with critical
insight beyond cavil. If, therefore, the actor
or actress who can sway great crowds is
strictly to be termed an artist, why may we not
also, by strict definition, similarly term as exponents
of an authentic art others who can
likewise sway the same crowds: a great politician
like Roosevelt, say, or a great lecturer
like Ingersoll, or a successful practical theologian
like Billy Sunday? (Let us send out
these paradox shock-troops to clear the way
for the more sober infantry.)</p>

<p>I have said that I have no intention to argue
for or against acting as an art yet, for all the
circumstance that the case for the prosecution
has long seemed the soundest and the most
eloquent, there are still sporadic instances of
imaginative histrionism that give one reason to
ponder. But, pondering, it has subsequently
come to the more penetrating critic that what
has on such occasions passed for an art has in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
reality been merely a reflected art: the art of
drama interpreted not with the imagination
of the actor but, more precisely, <i>with the imagination
of the dramatist</i>. In other words,
that actor or actress is the most competent and
effective whose imagination is successful in
meeting literally, and translating, the imagination
of the dramatist which has created the
r&#244;le played by the particular actor or actress.
To name the actor&#8217;s imagination in such a case
a creative imagination is a rather wistful procedure,
for it does not create but merely duplicates.
Surely no advocate of acting as a creative
art would be so bold as to contend that
any actor, however great, has ever brought
creative imagination to the already full and
superb creative imagination of Shakespeare.
This would be, on an actor&#8217;s part, the sheerest
impudence. The greatest actor is simply he
who is best fitted by figure, voice, training
and intelligence not to invade and annul the
power of the r&#244;le which a great dramatist has
imagined and created. Duse and D&#8217;Annunzio
were, so to speak, spiritually and physically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
one: hence the unmatched perfection of
the former&#8217;s histrionism in the latter&#8217;s r&#244;les.
To see Duse is, save one admit one&#8217;s self
critically to the facts, therefore to suffer theoretical
art doubts and the convictions of such
as Mr. Daly.</p>

<p>It is, of course, the common habit of the
prejudiced critic to overlook, in the estimate
of acting as an art, the few admirable exponents
of acting and to take into convenient
consideration only the enormous majority of
incompetents. But to argue that acting is
not an art simply because a thousand Edmund
Breeses and Miss Adele Bloods give no evidence
that it is an art is to argue that sculpture
is not an art simply because a thousand
fashioners of Kewpies and plaster of Paris
busts of Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Harding
give no evidence in a like direction. Yet the
circumstance that there are admittedly excellent
actors as well as bad actors establishes acting
as an art no more than the circumstance
that there are admittedly excellent cuckoo-whistlers
as well as bad cuckoo-whistlers establishes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the playing of the cuckoo-whistle as
an art. If I seem to reduce the comparison
to what appears to be an absurdity, it is because
by such absurdities, or elementals, is the
status of acting in the field of the arts most
sharply to be perceived. For if Bernhardt&#8217;s
ever-haunting cry of the heart in &#8220;Izeyl&#8221; is a
peg, however slight, upon which may be hung
a strand of the theory that maintains acting as
an art, so too, by the strict canon of dialectics,
is Mr. Ruben Katz&#8217;s ever-haunting cry of the
cuckoo in the coda of the slow movement of
Beethoven&#8217;s Pastoral Symphony.</p>

<p>If acting is an art, the proofs thus far
offered are not only unconvincing but fundamentally,
on the score of logic, not a little
droll. Let us view a few illustrations. If
criticism is an art (thus a familiar contention),
why is not acting also an art, since both are
concerned with re-creating works of art? But
the artist&#8217;s work offered up to the critic is a
challenge, whereas the dramatist&#8217;s work
offered up to the actor is a consonance. Criticism
is war, whether in behalf of &#230;sthetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
friend or against &#230;sthetic foe; acting is agreement,
peace. The critic re-creates, in terms
of his own personality, the work of another
and often emphatically different and antagonistic
personality. The actor re-creates, in
terms of a dramatist&#8217;s concordantly imagined
personality, his own personality: the result
is less re-creation than non-re-creation. In
other words, the less the actor creates or re-creates
and the more he remains simply an
adaptable tool in the hands of the dramatist,
the better actor he is. The actor&#8217;s state is
thus what may be termed one of active impassivity.
Originality and independence, save
within the narrowest of limits, are denied him.
He is a literal translator of a work of art, not
an independently imaginative and speculative
interpreter, as the critic is. The dramatist&#8217;s
work of art does not say to him, as to the critic,
&#8220;Here I am! What do you, out of all your
experience, taste and training, think of me?&#8221;
It says to him, instead and peremptorily,
&#8220;Here I am! Think of me exactly as I am,
and adapt all of your experience, taste and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
training to the interpretation of me exactly as
I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>Brushing aside the theory that the true
artist is the actor who can transform his voice,
his manner, his character; who will disappear
behind his part instead of imposing himself
on it and adding himself to it&mdash;a simple feat,
since by such a definition the Messrs. Fregoli
and Henri De Vries, amazing vaudeville protean
actors, are true histrionic artists&mdash;Mr.
Walkley, in his essay on &#8220;The English Actor
of Today,&#8221; bravely takes up the defence from
what he regards as a more difficult approach.
&#8220;In the art of acting as in any other art,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;the first requisite is life. The actor&#8217;s
part is a series of speeches and stage directions,
mere cold print, an inert mass that has to be
raised somehow from the dead. If the actor
disappears behind it, there is nothing left but
a Golgotha.&#8221; Here is indeed gay news!
Hamlet, Iago, Romeo, Shylock&mdash;mere &#8220;cold
print,&#8221; inert Shakespearian masses that, in
order to live, have to be raised somehow from
the dead by members of the Lambs&#8217; Club! It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
is only fair to add that Mr. Walkley quickly
takes to cover after launching this torpedo,
and devotes the balance of his interesting comments
to a prudent and circumspect <i>pas seul</i>
on the very middle of the controversial teeter-tawter.
For no sooner has he described the
majestic drama of Shakespeare as &#8220;mere cold
print, an inert mass that has to be raised somehow
from the dead,&#8221; than he seems suddenly,
and not without a touch of horror, to realize
that he has ridiculously made of Shakespeare a
mere blank canvas and pot of paint for the use
of this or that actor whom he has named, by
implication and with magnificent liberalness,
a Raphael, or a mere slab of cold marble for
the sculpturing skill of some socked and buskined
Merci&#233;.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Modern evaluation of acting as an unquestionable
art takes its key from R&#233;mond de
Sainte-Albine, the girlishly ebullient Frenchman
whose pragmatic critical credo was, &#8220;If
it makes me feel, it is art.&#8221; While it may be
reasonable that a purely emotional art may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
aptly be criticized according to the degree of
emotional reaction which it induces, it is the
quality of emotion resident in the critic that
offers that reasonableness a considerable confusion.
A perfectly attuned and sound emotional
equipment&mdash;an emotional equipment of
absolute pitch, so to speak&mdash;is a rare thing,
even among critics of brilliant intelligence,
taste, imagination and experience. Goethe,
Carlyle, Hazlitt, Dryden, Lessing, to mention
only five, were physio-psychological units of
dubious emotional structure, if we may trust
the intimate chronicles. Thus, where much of
their critical dramatic writing may be accepted
without qualm, a distinct measure of distrust
would attach itself to any critical estimate of
acting which they might have written or actually
did write.</p>

<p>There are, obviously, more or less definite
standards whereby we may estimate critical
writings of such men as these so far as those
criticisms deal with what we may roughly describe
as the cerebral or semi-cerebral arts, but
there are no standards, even remotely determinable
or exact, whereby we may appraise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
such of their criticisms as deal with the directly
and wholly emotional art of acting. It is perhaps
not too far a cry to assume that had Mr.
William Archer&#8217;s father been murdered
shortly before Mr. Archer witnessed Mr.
Forbes-Robertson&#8217;s Hamlet, Mr. Archer
would have been moved to believe Mr. Forbes-Robertson
on even greater actor-artist than he
believed him under the existing circumstances,
or that had Mr. Otto Borchsenius, the Danish
journalist-critic, regrettably found himself a
victim of syphilis when he reviewed August
Lindberg&#8217;s &#8220;Oswald,&#8221; he would have looked
on the estimable Lindberg as a doubly impressive
exponent of histrionism. Nothing is more
&#230;sthetically and artistically dubious and insecure
than the appraisal of acting; for it is
based upon the quicksands of varying human
emotionalism, and of aural and visual prejudice.
Were I, for example, one hundred times
more proficient a critic of drama and life than
I am, my criticism of acting would none the
less remain often arbitrary and erratic, for I
would remain constitutionally an&#230;sthetic to a
Juliet, however otherwise talented, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
piano legs, or to a Marc Antony who, for all
his histrionic power, presented to the vision a
pair of knock-knees. This, I well appreciate,
is the kind of critical writing that is promptly
set down as flippant, yet it is the truth so far as
I am concerned and I daresay that it is, in one
direction or another, the truth so far as the
majority of critics are concerned.</p>

<p>The most that may be said of the soundness
of this or that laudatory criticism of an actor&#8217;s
performance is that the performance in point
has met exactly&mdash;or very nearly&mdash;the particular
critic&#8217;s personal notion of how he, as a
human being, would have cried, laughed and
otherwise comported himself were he an actor
and were he in the actor&#8217;s r&#244;le. The opposite,
or denunciatory, phase of such criticism holds
a similar truth. If this is not true, by what
standards <i>can</i> the critic estimate the actor&#8217;s
performance? By the standards of the actors
who have preceded this actor in the playing
of the r&#244;le, you say? What if the r&#244;le is a
new one, a peculiar and novel one, that has
not been played before? Again, you say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
the r&#244;le may be in an alien drama and that
the actor may be an alien, both r&#244;le and
performance being foreign to the emotional
equipment of the critic. But basic emotions,
the foundation of drama, are universal.
Still again, what of such dramas as &#8220;&#338;dipus
Rex,&#8221; what of such r&#244;les&mdash;this with a triumphant
chuckle on your part? I return the
chuckle, and bid you read the criticisms that
have been written of the actors who have
played in these r&#244;les! Invariably the actors
have been treated in precisely the same terms
and by the same standards as if they were
playing, not in the drama of the fifth century
before Christ, but in &#8220;Fedora,&#8221; &#8220;The Face in
the Moonlight&#8221; or &#8220;The Count of Monte
Cristo.&#8221;</p>

<p>One cannot imagine sound criticism applying
to any authentic art the standard of actor
criticism that I have noted. Criticism, true
enough, is always more or less personal, but,
in its operation upon the authentic arts, its
personality is ever like a new bottle into which
the vintage wine of art has been poured.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Criticism of the authentic arts is the result of
the impact of a particular art upon a particular
critical personality. Criticism of the dubious
art of acting is the result of the impact of
a particular critical personality upon this or
that instance of acting. But if this is even remotely
true, you inquire ironically, what of
such an excellent instance of acting as Mimi
Aguglia&#8217;s &#8220;Salome&#8221;; how in God&#8217;s name may
the critic appraise that performance in the
manner set down, i. e., in terms of himself
were he a stage performer? Well, for all the
surface humours of the question, that is actually
more or less the way in which he does
appraise it. The actor or actress, unlike the
artist in more authentic fields, may never interpret
emotion in a manner unfamiliar to the
critic: the interpretation must be a reflection,
more or less stereotyped, of the critic&#8217;s repertoire
of emotions. Thus, where art is original
expression, acting is merely the audible expression
of a silent expression. In another
phrase, expression in acting is predicated
upon, and limited by, the expression of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
critic. It is, therefore, a mere duplication of
expression. And what holds true in the case
of the critic so far as acting is concerned obviously
holds doubly true in the case of the uncritical
public.</p>

<p>Re-reading the celebrated critiques of acting,
I come to the conclusion that the word
&#8220;art&#8221; has almost uniformly been applied to
acting by critics who, thinking that they had
perhaps belaboured the subject a trifle too
severely, were disposed graciously to throw it
a sop. As good an illustration as any may be
had from Lewes, certainly a friend of acting
if ever there was one. Thus Lewes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The truth is, we exaggerate the talent of an
actor because we judge only from the effect he
produces, without inquiring too curiously into the
means. But, while the painter has nothing but his
canvas and the author has nothing but white paper
and printers&#8217; ink with which to produce his effects,
the actor has all other arts as handmaids; the
poet labours for him, creates his part, gives him
his eloquence, his music, his imagery, his tenderness,
his pathos, his sublimity; the scene-painter aids
him; the costumes, the lights, the music, all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
fascination of the stage&mdash;all subserve the actor&#8217;s
effects; these raise him upon a pedestal; remove
them, and what is he? He who can make a stage
mob bend and sway with his eloquence, what could
he do with a real mob, no poet by to prompt
him? He who can charm us with the stateliest
imagery of a noble mind, when robed in the sables
of Hamlet, or in the toga of Coriolanus, what can
he do in coat and trousers on the world&#8217;s stage?
Rub off the paint, and the eyes are no longer
brilliant! Reduce the actor to his intrinsic value,
and then weigh him with the rivals whom he surpasses
in reputation and fortune.... If my
estimate of the intrinsic value of acting is lower
than seems generally current, it is from no desire
to disparage <i>an art</i> I have always loved; but,
etc., etc.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>You will find the same dido in most of the
essays on acting: a protracted series of cuffs
and slaps terminating in a gentle non-sequitur
kiss.</p>

<p>Acting at its finest is, however, often a confusing
hypnosis; it is not to be wondered at
that, fresh from its spell, the critic has mistaken
it for a more exalted something than it
intrinsically is. The flame and fire of a Duse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the haunt and magic of a Bernhardt, the powerful
stage sense of creation of a Moissi&mdash;these
are not a little befuddling. And, under
their serpent-like charm, it is not incomprehensible
that the critic should confound effect
and cause. Yet acting, even of the highest
order, is intrinsically akin to the legerdemain
of a Hermann or a Kellar with a Shakespeare
or a Moli&#232;re as an assistant to hand over, as
the moment bids, the necessary pack of cards
or bowl of goldfish. It is trickery raised to its
most exalted level: a combination of experience,
intelligence and great charm, not revivifying
something cold and dead, but releasing
something quick and alive from the prison
of the printed page.</p>

<p>The actor who contends in favour of his
creative art that he must experience within
him the feeling of the dramatist, that he must
actually persuade himself to feel his r&#244;le with
all its turning smiles and tears, speaks nonsense.
So, too, must the auditor, yet who
would term the auditor a creative artist? The
actor who contends in favour of his creative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
art the exact opposite, that he is, to wit, a
creative artist since he must theatrically create
the dramatist&#8217;s moods, illusions and emotions
without feeling them himself, also speaks nonsense.
For so, too, in such a case as &#8220;Electra,&#8221;
or &#8220;Ghosts,&#8221; or &#8220;No More Blondes,&#8221;
must the auditor, yet who, again, would term
the latter a creative artist? The actor who
contends in favour of his creative art that two
accomplished actors often &#8220;create&#8221; the same
r&#244;le in an entirely different manner, speaks
nonsense yet again. For what is not creation
in the first place does not become creation
merely because it is multiplied by two. The
actor who further contends in behalf of his
creative art that if effective acting were the
mere trickery that some maintain it to be, any
person ordinarily gifted should be able, after
a little experiment, to give an effective stage
performance, speaks truer than he knows.
Some of the most remarkable performances
on the stage of the Abbey Theatre of Dublin
have been given by just such persons. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
there are numerous other instances. If acting
is an art&mdash;and I do not say that it may
not be&mdash;it at least, as an art, ill bears cross-examination
of even the most superficial nature.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Acting is perhaps less an art than the deceptive
echo of an art. It is drama&#8217;s exalted
halloo come back to drama from the walls of
the surrounding amphitheatre. Criticism of
acting too often mistakes the echo for the
original voice. Although the analogy wears
motley, criticism of this kind operates in much
the same manner as if it were to contend that
an approximately exact and beautiful Ben Ali
Haggin <i>tableau vivant</i> reproduction of, say,
Velasquez&#8217;s &#8220;The Spinners,&#8221; was creative art
in the sense that the original is creative art.
Acting is to the art of the drama much what
these so-called living pictures are to the art
of painting. If acting is to be termed an art,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
it is, like the living picture, a freak art, an art
with belladonna in its eyes and ever, even at
its highest, a bit grotesque.</p>

<p>In his defence of acting as an art equal to
that of poetry and literature, Henry Irving
has observed, &#8220;It has been said that acting is
unworthy because it represents feigned emotions,
but this censure would apply with equal
force to poet or novelist.&#8221; But would it?
The poet and the novelist may feign emotions,
but it is their own active imaginations which
feign them. The actor merely feigns passively
the emotions which the imagination of
the poet has actively feigned; if there is feigning,
the actor merely parrots it. If there is
feigned emotion in, say, the second stanza of
Swinburne&#8217;s &#8220;Rococo,&#8221; and I mount an illuminated
platform and recite the stanza very
eloquently and impressively, am I precisely
feigning the emotion of it or am I merely
feigning the emotion that the great imagination
of Swinburne has feigned? Feigned or
unfeigned, the emotions of the poet come
ready-made to the heart and lips of the actor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>Continues Irving further: &#8220;It is the actor
who gives body to the ideas of the highest
dramatic literature&mdash;fire, force, and sensibility,
without which they would remain for
most people mere airy abstractions.&#8221; What
one engages here is the peculiar logic that acting
is an art since it popularizes dramatic
literature and makes it intelligible to a majority
of dunderheads!</p>

<p>One more quotation from this actor&#8217;s defence,
and we may pass on. &#8220;The actor&#8217;s
work is absolutely concrete,&#8221; he challenges.
&#8220;He is brought in every phase of his work into
direct comparison with existing things....
Not only must his dress be suitable to the part
which he assumes, but his bearing must not be
in any way antagonistic to the spirit of the
time in which the play is fixed. The free
bearing of the sixteenth century is distinct
from the artificial one of the seventeenth, the
mannered one of the eighteenth, and the careless
one of the nineteenth.... The voice
must be modulated to the vogue of the time.
The habitual action of a rapier-bearing age<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
is different from that of a mail-clad one&mdash;nay,
the armour of a period ruled in real life the
poise and bearing of the body; and all this
must be reproduced on the stage.... <i>It cannot
therefore be seriously put forward in the
face of such manifold requirements that no
Art is required for the representation of suitable
action!</i>&#8221; The italics are those of one who
experiences some difficulty in persuading himself
that if Art is required for such things as
these&mdash;dress, carriage, modulation of voice
and carrying a sword&mdash;Art, strictly speaking,
is no less required in the matter of going to a
Quat&#8217;-z-Arts costume ball.</p>

<p>Acting is perhaps best to be criticized not
as art but as colourful and impressive artifice.
Miss Margaret Anglin&#8217;s Joan of Arc is
a more or less admirable example of acting not
because it is art but because it is a shrewd,
vivid and beguiling synthesis of various intrinsically
spurious dodges: black tights to
make stout Anglo-Saxon limbs appear Gallicly
slender, a telescoping of words containing
the sound of <i>s</i> to conceal a personal defect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
in the structure of the upper lip, a man&#339;uvring
of the central action up stage to emphasize,
through a familiar trick of the theatre, the
sympathetic frailty of the character which the
actress herself physically lacks, two intakes of
breath before a shout of defiance that the effect
of the ring of the directly antecedent
shout on the part of one of the inquisitors may
be diminished.... An effective acting performance
is like a great explosion; and as
T N T is made from nitric acid, which is in
turn made from such nitrates as potassium
nitrate or saltpeter, which are in turn derived
from the salts of decomposed guano, so is a
great explosion of histrionism similarly made
and derived from numerous&mdash;and not infrequently
ludicrous and even vulgar&mdash;basic
elements.</p>

<p>The ill-balanced species of criticism which
appraises an histrionic performance as art on
the sole ground of the hypnotic effect it produces,
with no inquiry into the means whereby
that effect is produced, might analogously,
were it to pursue this logic, appraise similarly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
as art the performance of an adept literal hypnotist.
And with logic perhaps much more
sound. For if acting as an art is to be appraised
in the degree of the effect it imparts
to, and induces in, the auditor-spectator,
surely&mdash;if there is any sense at all in such a
method of estimate&mdash;may certain other such
performances as I have suggested be similarly
appraised. Criticism rests upon a foundation
of logic; whatever it may deal with&mdash;&#230;sthetics,
emotions, what not&mdash;it cannot remove itself
entirely from that foundation. Thus, if Mr.
John Barrymore is an artist because, by identifying
the heart and mind of his auditor-spectator
with some such character as Fedya and
by suggesting directly that character&#8217;s tragic
d&#233;gringolade, he can make the auditor-spectator
pity and cry, so too an artist&mdash;by the
rigid canon of &#230;sthetic criticism&mdash;was Friedrich
Anton Mesmer, who is said to have been
able to do the same thing.</p>

<p>What I attempt here is no facile paradox,
but a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> designed to show
up the fallacy of the prevailing method of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
actor criticism. In criticism of the established
arts, there is no such antic deportment. The
critic never confuses the stimulations of jazz
music with those of sound music, nor the stimulations
of open melodrama with those of
more profound drama. From each of these
he receives stimulations of a kind: some superficial,
some deep. But he inquires, in each instance,
into the means whereby the various
stimulations were vouchsafed to him. While
he recognizes the fact that the sudden and unexpected
shooting off of a revolver in &#8220;Secret
Service&#8221; produces in him a sensation of shock
as great as the sudden and unexpected shooting
off of a revolver in &#8220;Hedda Gabler,&#8221; he
does not therefore promptly, and with no
further reasoning, conclude that the two sensations
are of an &#230;sthetic piece. Nor does he
assume that, since the nervous effect of the
fall to death in &#8220;The Green Goddess&#8221; and of
the fall to death in &#8220;The Master Builder&#8221; affect
him immediately in much the same way,
both sensations are accordingly produced by
sound artistic means. Nor, yet again, does he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
confuse the quality&mdash;nor the springs of that
quality&mdash;of the mood of wistful pathos with
which &#8220;Poor Butterfly&#8221; and &#8220;Porgi, Amor&#8221;
inspire him. But this confusion persists as
part and parcel of the bulk of the criticism of
acting. For one Hazlitt, or Lamb, or Lewes,
or Anatole France who retains, or has retained,
his clear discernment before the acted drama,
there are, and have been, a number tenfold
who have confounded the wonders of the phonograph
with the wonders of Josef Haydn.</p>

</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap2">ARTHUR BINGHAM WALKLEY
begins one of the best books ever written
on the subject thus: &#8220;It is not to be
gainsaid that the word criticism has gradually
acquired a certain connotation of contempt....
Every one who expresses opinions, however
imbecile, in print calls himself a &#8216;critic.&#8217;
The greater the ignoramus, the greater the
likelihood of his posing as a &#8216;critic.&#8217;&#8221; An excellent
book, as I have said, with a wealth of
sharp talk in it, but Mr. Walkley seems to me
to err somewhat in his preliminary assumption.
Criticism has acquired a connotation of contempt
less because it is practised by a majority
of ignoramuses than because it is accepted
at full face value by an infinitely greater majority
of ignoramuses. It is not the mob that
curls a lip&mdash;the mob accepts the lesser ignoramus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
at his own estimate of himself; it is the
lonely and negligible minority man who, pausing
musefully in the field that is the world,
contemplates the jackasses eating the daisies.</p>

<p>No man is so contemptuous of criticism as
the well-stocked critic, just as there is no man
so contemptuous of clothes as the man with the
well-stocked wardrobe. It is as impossible to
imagine a critic like Shaw not chuckling derisively
at criticism as it is to imagine a regular
subscriber to the <i>Weekly Review</i> not swallowing
it whole. The experienced critic, being
on the inside, is in a position to look into
the heads of the less experienced, and to see
the wheels go round. He is privy to all their
monkeyshines, since he is privy to his own.
Having graduated from quackery, he now
smilingly regards others still at the trade of
seriously advancing sure cures for &#230;sthetic
baldness, cancer, acne and trifacial neuralgia.
And while the yokels rub in the lotions and
swallow the pills, he permits himself a small,
but eminently sardonic, hiccup.</p>

<p>It is commonly believed that the first virtue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
of a critic is honesty. As a matter of fact,
in four cases out of five, honesty is the last
virtue of a critic. As criticism is practised in
America, honesty presents itself as the leading
fault. There is altogether too much honesty.
The greater the blockhead, the more
honest he is. And as a consequence the criticism
of these blockheads, founded upon their
honest convictions, is worthless. There is
some hope for an imbecile if he is dishonest,
but none if he is resolute in sticking to his
idiocies. If the average American critic were
to cease writing what he honestly believes and
dishonestly set down what he doesn&#8217;t believe,
the bulk of the native criticism would gain
some common sense and take on much of the
sound value that it presently lacks. Honesty
is a toy for first-rate men; when lesser
men seek to play with it and lick off the paint,
they come down with colic.</p>

<p>It is further maintained that enthusiasm is
a supplementary desideratum in a critic, that
unless he is possessed of enthusiasm he cannot
impart a warm love for fine things to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
reader. Surely this, too, is nonsense. Enthusiasm
is a virtue not in the critic, but in
the critic&#8217;s reader. And such desired enthusiasm
can be directly generated by enthusiasm
no more than a glyceryl nitrate explosion can
be generated by sulfuric acid. Enthusiasm
may be made so contagious as to elect a man
president of the United States or to raise an
army large enough to win a world war, but
it has never yet been made sufficiently contagious
to persuade one American out of a hundred
thousand that Michelangelo&#8217;s David of
the Signoria is a better piece of work than the
Barnard statue of Lincoln. Enthusiasm is
an attribute of the uncritical, the defectively
educated: stump speakers, clergymen, young
girls, opera-goers, Socialists, Italians, such
like. And not only an attribute, but a
weapon. But the cultivated and experienced
man has as little use for enthusiasm as for indignation.
He appreciates that while it may
convert a pack of ignoble doodles, it can&#8217;t convert
any one worth converting. The latter
must be persuaded, not inflamed. He realizes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
that where a double brass band playing
&#8220;Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean&#8221; may leave
a civilized Englishman cold to the virtues of
the United States, proof that the United
States has the best bathroom plumbing in the
world may warm him up a bit. The sound
critic is not a cheer leader, but a referee. Art
is hot, criticism cold. Aristotle&#8217;s criticism of
Euripides is as placid and reserved as Mr.
William Archer&#8217;s criticism of the latest
drama at the St. James&#8217;s Theatre; Bruneti&#232;re
is as calm over his likes as Mr. H. T.
Parker of the Boston <i>Transcript</i>. There is
no more enthusiasm in Lessing than there is
indignation in Walkley. Hazlitt, at a hundred
degrees emotional Fahrenheit, remains
critically cool as a cucumber. To find enthusiasm,
you will have to read the New York
<i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm, in short, is the endowment of
immaturity. The greater the critic, the
greater his disinclination to communicate
&#230;sthetic heat. Such communication savours
of propaganda and, however worthy that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
propaganda, he will have naught to do with its
trafficking. If the ability to possess and communicate
enthusiasm is the mark of the true
critic, then the theatrical page of the New
York <i>Journal</i> is the greatest critical literature
in America.</p>

<p>A third contention has it that aloofness and
detachment are no less valuable to the dramatic
critic than honesty and enthusiasm.
Unless I am seriously mistaken, also bosh.
Dramatic criticism is fundamentally the critic&#8217;s
art of appraising himself in terms of various
forms of drama. Or, as I some time ago
put it, the only sound dramatic critic is the
one who reports less the impression that this
or that play makes upon him than the impression
he makes upon this or that play. Of all
the forms of criticism, dramatic criticism is
essentially, and perhaps correctly, the most
personal. Tell me what a dramatic critic eats
and drinks, how far north of Ninetieth Street
he lives, what he considers a pleasant evening
when he is not in the theatre, and what kind
of lingerie his wife wears, and I&#8217;ll tell you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
with very few misses what kind of critic he is.
I&#8217;ll tell you whether he is fit to appreciate
Schnitzler, or whether he is fit only for Augustus
Thomas. I&#8217;ll tell you in advance what
he will think about, and how he will react to,
Hauptmann, Sacha Guitry or George V.
Hobart. I&#8217;ll tell you whether he is the sort
that makes a great to-do when his eagle eye
spots Sir Nigel Waterhouse, M.P., in Act II
fingering a copy of the Philadelphia <i>Public
Ledger</i> instead of the London <i>Times</i>, and
whether he is the sort that writes &#8220;Mr. John
Cort has staged the play in his customary
lavish manner&#8221; when the rise of the curtain
discloses to him a room elaborately decorated
in the latest Macy mode. To talk about the
value of detachment in a dramatic critic is to
talk about the value of detachment in a
Swiss mountain guide. The criticism is the
man; the man the criticism.</p>

<p>Of all forms of criticism, dramatic criticism
is the most purely biological. Were the
genii to put the mind of Max Beerbohm into
the head of Mr. J. Ranken Towse, and vice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
versa, their criticisms would still remain exactly
as they are. But, on the contrary, were
the head of Mr. J. Ranken Towse to be placed
on the body of Max Beerbohm, and vice versa,
their criticisms would take on points of view
diametrically opposed to their present. Max
would begin admiring the Rev. Dr. Charles
Rann Kennedy and Towse would promptly
proceed to put on his glasses to get a better
view of the girl on the end. Every book of
dramatic criticism&mdash;every single piece of
dramatic criticism&mdash;is a searching, illuminating
autobiography. The dramatic critic performs
a clinic upon himself every time he takes
his pen in his hand. He may try, as Walkley
puts it, to substitute for the capital I&#8217;s &#8220;nouns
of multitude signifying many,&#8221; or some of
those well-worn stereotypes&mdash;&#8220;It is thought,&#8221;
&#8220;one may be pardoned for hinting,&#8221; &#8220;will any
one deny?&#8221; etc., etc.&mdash;by which criticism keeps
up the pretence that it is not a man but a corporation,
but he fools no one.</p>

<p>To ask the dramatic critic to keep himself
out of his criticism, to detach himself, is thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
a trifle like asking an actor to keep himself out
of his r&#244;le. Dramatic critics and actors are
much alike. The only essential difference is
that the actor does his acting on a platform.
But, platform or no platform, the actor and
the dramatic critic best serve their r&#244;les when
they filter them through their own personalities.
A dramatic critic who is told to keep
his personality out of his criticism is in the
position of an actor who, being physically and
temperamentally like Mr. John Barrymore, is
peremptorily directed by a producer to stick
a sofa pillow under his belt, put on six extra
heel-lifts, acquire a whiskey voice and play
Falstaff like the late Sir Herbert Tree. The
best dramatic critics from the time of Quintus
Horatius Flaccus (<i>vide</i> the &#8220;Epistola&#8221;) have
sunk their vivid personalities into their work
right up to the knees. Not only have they described
the adventures of their souls among
masterpieces, but the adventures of their kidneys,
spleens and <i>c&#230;ca</i> as well. Each has held
the mirror of drama up to his own nature,
with all its idiosyncrasies. And in it have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
been sharply reflected not the cut and dried
features of the professor, but the vital features
of a red-alive man. The other critics
have merely held up the mirror to these
red-alive men, and have reflected not themselves
but the latter. Then, in their vainglory,
they have looked again into the hand-glass
and have mistaken the reflection of the
parrot for an eagle.</p>

<p>A third rubber-stamp: the critic must have
sympathy. As properly contend that a surgeon
must have sympathy. The word is misused.
What the critic must have is not sympathy,
which in its common usage bespeaks a
measure of sentimental concern, but interest.
If a dramatic critic, for example, has sympathy
for an actress he can no more criticize
her with poise than a surgeon can operate on
his own wife. The critic may on occasion
have sympathy as the judge in a court of law
may on occasion have it, but if he is a fair
critic, or a fair judge, he can&#8217;t do anything
about it, however much he would like to. Between
the fair defendant in the lace baby collar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
and a soft heart, Article X, Section 123, Page
416, absurdly interposes itself. (In example,
being a human being with a human being&#8217;s
weaknesses before a critic, I would often rather
praise a lovely one when she is bad than an
unlovely one when she is good&mdash;and, alas, I
fear that I sometimes do&mdash;but in the general
run I try to remember my business and behave
myself. It isn&#8217;t always easy. But I do my
best, and angels and Lewes could do no
more.) The word sympathy is further mishandled,
as in the similar case of the word
enthusiasm. What a critic should have is not,
as is common, sympathy and enthusiasm
<i>before</i> the fact, but <i>after</i> it. The critic who
enters a theatre bubblingly certain that he is
going to have a good time is no critic. The
critic is he who leaves a theatre cheerfully
certain that he <i>has</i> had a good time. Sympathy
and enthusiasm, unless they are <i>ex post
facto</i>, are precisely like prevenient prejudice
and hostility. Sympathy has no more preliminary
place in the equipment of a critic than
in the equipment of an ambulance driver or a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
manufacturer of bird cages. It is the caboose
of criticism, not the engine.</p>

<p>The trouble with dramatic criticism in
America, speaking generally, is that where it
is not frankly reportorial it too often seeks to
exhibit a personality when there exists no personality
to exhibit. Himself perhaps conscious
of this lack, the critic indulges in heroic
makeshifts to inject into his writings a note of
individuality, and the only individuality that
comes out of his perspirations is of a piece
with that of the bearded lady or the dog-faced
boy. Individuality of this freak species
is the bane of the native criticism. The college
professor who, having nothing to say, tries
to give his criticism an august air by figuratively
attaching to it a pair of whiskers and
horn glasses, the suburban college professor
who sedulously practises an aloofness from the
madding crowd that his soul longs to be part
of, the college professor who postures as a
man of the world, the newspaper reporter who
postures as a college professor, the journalist
who performs in terms of Art between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
Saks and Gimbel advertisements&mdash;these and
others like them are the sad comedians in the
tragical crew. In their heavy attempts to
live up to their fancy dress costumes, in their
laborious efforts to conceal their humdrum
personalities in the uncomfortable gauds of
Petruchio and Gobbo, they betray themselves
even to the bus boys. The same performer
cannot occupy the r&#244;les of Polonius and Hamlet,
even in a tank town troupe.</p>

<p>No less damaging to American dramatic
criticism is the dominant notion that criticism,
to be valuable, must be constructive. That is,
that it must, as the phrase has it, &#8220;build up&#8221;
rather than &#8220;tear down.&#8221; As a result of this
conviction we have an endless repertoire of
architectonic advice from critics wholly without
the structural faculty, advice which, were
it followed, would produce a drama twice as
poor as that which they criticize. Obsessed
with the idea that they must be constructive,
the critics know no lengths to which they will
not go in their sweat to dredge up cures of
one sort or another. They constructively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
point out that Shaw&#8217;s plays would be better
plays if Shaw understood the punctual technique
of Pinero, thus destroying a &#8220;C&#230;sar and
Cleopatra&#8221; to construct a &#8220;Second Mrs. Tanqueray.&#8221;
They constructively point out the
trashy aspect of some Samuel Shipman&#8217;s
&#8220;Friendly Enemies,&#8221; suggest more serious enterprises
to him, and get the poor soul to write
a &#8220;The Unwritten Chapter&#8221; which is ten
times as bad. They are not content to be
critics; they must also be playwrights. They
stand in mortal fear of the old recrimination,
&#8220;He who can, does; he who can&#8217;t, criticizes,&#8221;
not pausing to realize that the names of Mr.
Octavus Roy Cohen and Matthew Arnold may
be taken as somewhat confounding respective
examples. They note with some irritation that
the critic for the Wentzville, Mo., <i>Beacon</i> is a
destructive critic, but are conveniently ignorant
of the fact&mdash;which may conceivably prove
something more&mdash;that so was George Farquhar.
If destructive criticism, in their meaning,
is criticism which pulls down without
building up in return, three-fourths of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
best dramatic criticism written since the time
of Boileau, fully filling the definition, is
worthless. One can&#8217;t cure a yellow fever patient
by pointing out to him that he should
have caught the measles. One can&#8217;t improve
the sanitary condition of a neighbourhood
merely by giving the outhouse a different coat
of paint. The foe of destructive criticism is
the pro-German of American art.</p>

<p>Our native criticism suffers further from
the commercial Puritanism of its mediums.
What is often mistaken for the Puritanism of
the critic is actually the commercial Puritanism
forced upon him by the owner and publisher
of the journal in which his writings appear,
and upon which he has to depend for a
livelihood. Although this owner and publisher
is often not personally the Puritan, he
is yet shrewdly aware that the readers of his
journal are, and out of this awareness he becomes
what may be termed a circulation blue-nose.
Since circulation and advertising revenue
are twins, he must see to it that the sensibilities
of the former are not offended. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
his circumspection, conveyed to the critic by
the copy reader or perhaps only sensed, brings
about the Puritan play-acting by the critic.
This accounts to no little degree for the hostile
and uncritical reviews of even the most
finished risqu&#233; farces, and of the best efforts
of American and European playwrights to
depict truthfully and fairly the more unpleasant
phases of sex. &#8220;I agree with you that
this last naughty farce of Avery Hopwood&#8217;s
is awfully funny stuff,&#8221; a New York newspaper
reviewer once said to me; &#8220;I laughed
at it until my ribs ached; but I don&#8217;t dare
write as much. One can&#8217;t praise such things
in a paper with the kind of circulation that
ours has.&#8221; It is criticism bred from this commercial
Puritanism that has held back farce
writing in America, and I venture to say
much serious dramatic writing as well. The
best farce of a Guitry or a Dieudonn&#233;,
produced in America today without childish
excisions, would receive unfavourable notices
from nine newspapers out of ten. The best
sex drama of a Porto-Riche or a Wedekind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
would suffer&mdash;indeed, already has suffered&mdash;a
similar fate. I predicted to Eugene
O&#8217;Neill, the moment I laid down the manuscript
of his pathological play &#8220;Diff&#8217;rent,&#8221; the
exact manner in which, two months later, the
axes fell upon him.</p>

<p>For one critic like Mr. J. Ranken Towse
who is a Puritan by tradition and training,
there are a dozen who are Puritans by proxy.
One can no more imagine a dramatic critic on
a newspaper owned by Mr. Cyrus H. K. Curtis
praising Schnitzler&#8217;s &#8220;Reigen&#8221; or Rip&#8217;s and
Gignoux&#8217;s &#8220;Scandale de Deauville&#8221; than one
can imagine the same critic denouncing &#8220;Ben
Hur.&#8221; What thus holds true in journalistic
criticism holds true in precisely the same way
in the criticism written by the majority of
college professors. I doubt that there is a
college professor in America today who, however
much he admired a gay, reprobate farce
like &#8220;Le Rubicon&#8221; or &#8220;L&#8217;Illusioniste,&#8221; would
dare state his admiration in print. Puritan
or no Puritan, it is professionally necessary
for him to comport himself as one. His university<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
demands it, silently, sternly, idiotically.
He is the helpless victim of its &#230;sthetic
Ku Klux. Behind any drama dealing
unconventionally with sex, there hovers a
spectre that vaguely resembles Professor
Scott Nearing. He sees it ... he reflects
... he works up a safe indignation.</p>

<p>Dramatic criticism travels, in America,
carefully laid tracks. Signal lights, semaphores
and one-legged old men with red flags
are stationed along the way to protect it at
the crossings, to make it safe, and to guard it
from danger. It elaborately steams, pulls,
puffs, chugs, toots, whistles, grinds and rumbles
for three hundred miles&mdash;and brings up at
something like Hinkletown, Pa. It is eager,
but futile. It is honest, but so is Dr. Frank
Crane. It is fearless, but so is the actor who
plays the hero strapped to the papier-m&#226;ch&#233;
buzz-saw. It is constructive, but so is an embalmer.
It is detached, but so is a man in the
Fiji Islands. It is sympathetic, but so is a
quack prostatitician.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI. DRAMATIC CRITICISM IN
AMERICA</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">DRAMATIC criticism, at its best, is
the adventure of an intelligence
among emotions. The chief end
of drama is the enkindling of emotions; the
chief end of dramatic criticism is to rush into
the burning building and rescue the metaphysical
weaklings who are wont to be overcome
by the first faint whiffs of smoke.</p>

<p>Dramatic criticism, in its common run,
fails by virtue of its confusion of unschooled
emotion with experienced emotion. A dramatic
critic who has never been kissed may
properly appreciate the readily assimilable
glories of &#8220;Romeo and Juliet,&#8221; but it is doubtful
that he will be able properly to appreciate
the somewhat more evasive splendours of
&#8220;Liebelei.&#8221; The capability of a judge does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
not, of course, depend upon his having himself
once been in jail, nor does the capability
of a critic depend upon his having personally
once experienced the emotions of the dramatis
person&#230;, but that critic is nevertheless the
most competent whose emotions the dramatis
person&#230; do not so much anticipatorily stir up
as recollectively soothe.</p>

<p>All criticism is more or less a statement in
terms of the present of what one has viewed
of the past through a delicate, modern reducing-glass.
Intelligence is made up, in large
part, of dead emotions; ignorance, of emotions
that have lived on, deaf and dumb and
crippled, but ever smiling. The general admission
that a dramatic critic must be experienced
in drama, literature, acting and theories
of production but not necessarily in emotions
is somewhat difficult of digestion. Such a
critic may conceivably comprehend much of
Sheridan, Moli&#232;re, Bernhardt and Yevreynoff,
but a hundred searching and admirable
things like the beginning of &#8220;Anatol,&#8221; the
middle of &#8220;Lonely Lives&#8221; and the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
&#8220;The Case of Rebellious Susan&#8221; must inevitably
be without his ken, and baffle his efforts at
sound penetration. I do not here posture
myself as one magnificently privy to all the
mysteries, but rather as one who, failing perhaps
to be on very intimate terms with them,
detects and laments the deficiencies that confound
him. Experience, goeth the saw, is a
wise master. But it is, for the critic, an even
wiser slave. A critic on the Marseilles <i>Petits
Pois</i> may critically admire &#8220;La Derni&#232;re Nuit
de Don Juan,&#8221; but it takes an Anatole France
critically to understand it.</p>

<p>The superficial quality of American emotions,
sociological and &#230;sthetic, enjoyed by the
great majority of American critics, operates
extensively against profundity in American
criticism&mdash;in that of literature and music no
less than that of drama. American emotions,
speaking in the mass, where they are not the
fixed and obvious emotions ingenerate in most
countries&mdash;such as love of home, family and
country, and so on&mdash;are one-syllable emotions,
primary-colour emotions. The polysyllabic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
and pastel emotions are looked on as dubious,
even degenerate. No man, for example, who,
though absolutely faithful to his wife, confessed
openly that he had winked an eye at a
ballet girl could conceivably be elected to
membership in the Union League Club. The
man who, after a cocktail, indiscreetly gave
away the news that he had felt a tear of joy
in his eye when he heard the minuet of Mozart&#8217;s
G minor symphony or a tear of sadness
when he looked upon Corot&#8217;s &#8220;La Solitude,&#8221;
would be promptly set down by the other
members of the golf club as a dipsomaniac
who was doubtless taking narcotics on the
side. If a member of the Y. M. C. A. were
to glance out of the window and suddenly
ejaculate, &#8220;My, what a beautiful girl!&#8221; the
superintendent would immediately grab him
by the seat of the pantaloons and throw him
down the back stairs. And if a member of
the American Legion were to sniffle so much
as once when the orchestra in the Luna Park
dance hall played &#8220;Wiener Blut,&#8221; a spy
would seize him by the ear and hurry him before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
the heads of the organization as a suspicious
fellow, in all probability of German
blood.</p>

<p>The American is either ashamed of honest
emotion or, if he is not ashamed, is soon
shamed into shame by his neighbours. He is
profoundly affected by any allusion to Mother,
the Baby, or the Flag&mdash;the invincible trinity
of American dramatic hokum&mdash;and his reactions
thereto meet with the full favour of
church and state; but he is unmoved, he is
silently forbidden to be moved, by a love that
doesn&#8217;t happen to fall into the proper pigeon-hole,
by a work of great beauty that doesn&#8217;t
happen to preach a backwoods Methodist sermon,
by sheer loveliness, or majesty, or unadorned
truth. And this corsetted emotion,
mincing, wasp-waisted and furtive, colours
all native criticism. It makes the dramatic
critic ashamed of simple beauty, and forbids
him honestly to admire the mere loveliness of
such exhibitions as Ziegfeld&#8217;s. It makes him
ashamed of passion, and forbids him honestly
to admire such excellent dramas as Georges de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Porto-Riche&#8217;s &#8220;Amoureuse.&#8221; It makes him
ashamed of laughter, and forbids him to
chuckle at the little naughtinesses of Sacha
Guitry and his own Avery Hopwood. It
makes him ashamed of truth, and forbids him
to regard with approbation such a play as
&#8220;The Only Law.&#8221; The American drama
must therefore not create new emotions for
him, but must hold the battered old mirror up
to his own. It must warm him not with new,
splendid and worldly emotions, but must satisfy
him afresh as to the integrity and higher
merit of his own restricted parcel of emotions.
It must abandon all new, free concepts of
love and life, of romance and adventure and
glory, and must reassure him&mdash;with appropriate
quiver-music&mdash;that the road to heaven
is up Main Street and the road to hell down
the Avenue de l&#8217;Op&#233;ra.</p>

<p>Though there is a regrettable trace of snobbery
in the statement, it yet remains that&mdash;with
half a dozen or so quickly recognizable
exceptions&mdash;the practitioners of dramatic criticism
in America are in the main a humbly-born,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
underpaid and dowdy-lived lot. This
was as true of them yesterday as it is today.
And as Harlem, delicatessen-store dinners,
napkin-rings and the Subway are not, perhaps,
best conducive to a polished and suavely
cosmopolitan outlook on life and romance and
enthralling beauty, we have had a dramatic
criticism pervaded by a vainglorious homeliness,
by a side-street &#230;sthetic, and by not a
little of the difficultly suppressed rancour that
human nature ever feels in the presence of admired
yet unachievable situations. Up to
fifteen years ago, drama in America was compelled
critically to meet with, and adhere
strictly to, the standards of life, culture and
romance as they obtained over on Mr. William
Winter&#8217;s Staten Island. Since Winter&#8217;s
death, it has been urged critically to abandon
the standards of Staten Island and comply
instead with the eminently more sophisticated
standards derived from a four years&#8217; study of
Cicero, Stumpf and the Norwegian system of
communal elections at Harvard or Catawba
College, combined with a two weeks&#8217; stay in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
Paris. For twenty years, Ibsen and Pinero
suffered the American critical scourge because
they had not been born and brought up
in a town with a bust of Cotton Mather or
William Cullen Bryant in its public square,
and did not think quite the same way about
things as Horace Greeley. For twenty years
more, Porto-Riche and Frenchmen like him
will doubtless suffer similarly because, in a
given situation, they do not act precisely as
Mr. Frank A. Munsey or Dr. Stuart Pratt
Sherman would; for twenty years more,
Hauptmann and other Germans will doubtless
be viewed with a certain measure of condescension
because they have not enjoyed the
same advantages as Professor Brander Matthews
in buying Liberty Bonds, at par.</p>

<p>American dramatic criticism is, and always
has been, essentially provincial. It began by
mistaking any cheap melodrama like &#8220;The
Charity Ball&#8221; or &#8220;The Wife&#8221; which was camouflaged
with a few pots of palms and half a
dozen dress suits for a study of American society.
It progressed by appraising as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
dean of American dramatists and as the leading
American dramatic thinker a playwright
who wrote such stuff as &#8220;All over this great
land thousands of trains run every day, starting
and arriving in punctual agreement because
this is a woman&#8217;s world! The great
steamships, dependable almost as the sun&mdash;a
million factories in civilization&mdash;the countless
looms and lathes of industry&mdash;the legions of
labour that weave the riches of the world&mdash;all&mdash;all
move by the mainspring of man&#8217;s faith
in woman!&#8221; It has come to flower today in
denouncing what the best European critics
have proclaimed to be the finest example of
American fantastic comedy on the profound
ground that &#8220;it is alien to American morality,&#8221;
and in hailing as one of the most acute
studies of a certain typical phase of American
life a comedy filched substantially from the
French.</p>

<p>The plush-covered provincialism of the native
dramatic criticism, operating in this wise
against conscientious drama and sound appreciation
of conscientious drama, constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
betrays itself for all the chintz hocus-pocus
with which it seeks drolly to conceal that provincialism.
For all its easy incorporation of
French phrases laboriously culled from the
back of Webster, its casually injected allusions
to the &#220;berbrett&#8217;l, Stanislav Pshibuishevsky,
the excellent <i>cuissot de Chevreuil
sauce poivrade</i> to be had in the little restaurant
near the comfort station in the Place Pigalle,
and the bewitching eyes of the prima ballerina
in the 1917 Y. M. C. A. show at Epernay, it
lets its mask fall whenever it is confronted in
the realistic flesh by one or another of the very
things against which it has postured its cosmopolitanism.
Thus does the mask fall, and
reveal the old pair of suburban eyes, before
the &#8220;indelicacy&#8221; of French dramatic masterpieces,
before the &#8220;polished wit&#8221; of British
polished witlessness, before the &#8220;stodginess&#8221;
of the German master depictions of stodgy
German peasantry, before the &#8220;gloom&#8221; of
Russian dramatic photography, before the
&#8220;sordidness&#8221; of &#8220;Countess Julie&#8221; and the
&#8220;wholesomeness&#8221; of &#8220;The Old Homestead.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Cosmopolitanism is a heritage, not an acquisition.
It may be born to a man in a wooden
shack in Hardin County, in Kentucky, or in
a little cottage in Hampshire in England, or
in a garret of Paris, but, unless it is so born
to him, a thousand Cunard liners and Orient
Expresses cannot bring it to him. All criticism
is geography of the mind and geometry
of the heart. American criticism suffers in
that what &#230;sthetic wanderlust its mind experiences
is confined to excursion trips, and in
that what <i>x</i> its heart seeks to discover is an
unknown quantity only to emotional sub-freshmen.</p>

<p>Criticism is personal, or it is nothing. Talk
to me of impersonal criticism, and I&#8217;ll talk to
you of impersonal sitz-bathing. Impersonal
criticism is the dodge of the critic without personality.
Some men marry their brother&#8217;s
widow; some earn a livelihood imitating
George M. Cohan; some write impersonal
criticism. Show me how I can soundly criticize
Mrs. Fiske as Hannele without commenting
on the mature aspect of the lady&#8217;s <i>stentopgia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
and I shall begin to believe that there may
be something in the impersonal theory. Show
me how I can soundly criticize the drama of
Wedekind without analyzing Wedekind, the
man, and I shall believe in the theory to the
full. It is maintained by the apostles of the
theory that the dramatic critic is in the position
of a judge in the court of law: that his
concern, like that of the latter, is merely with
the evidence presented to him, not with the
personalities of those who submit the evidence.
Nothing could be more idiotic. The judge
who does not take into consideration, for example,
that&mdash;whatever the nature of the evidence&mdash;the
average Italian, or negro, or Armenian
before him is in all probability lying
like the devil is no more equipped to be a
sound judge than the dramatic critic who, for
all the stage evidence, fails to take into consideration
that Strindberg personally was a
lunatic, that Pinero, while treating of British
impulses and character, is himself of ineradicable
Portuguese mind and blood, that the inspiration
of D&#8217;Annunzio came not from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
woman out of life but from a woman out of
the greenroom, and that Shaw is a legal virgin.</p>

<p>Just as dramatic criticism, as it is practised
in America, is Mason-jar criticism&mdash;criticism,
that is, obsessed by a fixed determination to
put each thing it encounters into an air-tight
bottle and to label it&mdash;so is this dramatic criticism
itself in turn subjected to the bottling
and labelling process. A piece of criticism,
however penetrating, that is not couched in the
language of the commencement address of the
president of Millsaps College, and that fails
to include a mention of the Elizabethan theatre
and a quotation from Victor Hugo&#8217;s &#8220;Hernani,&#8221;
is labelled &#8220;journalistic.&#8221; A criticism
that elects to make its points with humour
rather than without humour is labelled &#8220;flippant.&#8221;
A criticism that shows a wide knowledge
of everything but the subject in hand
is labelled &#8220;scholarly.&#8221; One that, however
empty, prefixes every name with a Mr. and
somewhere in it discloses the fact that the
critic is sixty-five years old is labelled &#8220;dignified.&#8221;
One that is full of hard common sense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
from beginning to end but is guilty of wit is
derogatorily labelled &#8220;an imitation of Bernard
Shaw.&#8221; One that says an utterly worthless
play is an utterly worthless play, and then
shuts up, is labelled &#8220;destructive&#8221;; while one
that points out that the same play would be a
much better play if Hauptmann or De Curel
had written it is labelled &#8220;constructive and informing.&#8221;
And so it goes. With the result
that dramatic criticism in America is a dead
art language. Like Mr. William Jennings
Bryan, it has been criticized to death.</p>

<p>The American mania for being on the popular
side has wrapped its tentacles around
the American criticism of the theatre. The
American critic, either because his job depends
upon it or because he appreciates that
<i>kudos</i> in this country, as in no other, is a gift
of the mob, sedulously plays safe. A sheep,
he seeks the comfortable support of other
sheep. It means freedom from alarums, a
guaranteed pay envelope at the end of the
week, dignity in the eyes of the community,
an eventual election to the National Institute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
of Arts and Letters and, when he reaches
three score years and ten and his trousers have
become thin in the seat, a benefit in the Century
Theatre with a bill made up of all
the eminent soft-shoe dancers and fat tragediennes
upon whom he has lavished praise.
This, in America, is the respected critic. If
we had among us today a Shaw, or a Walkley,
or a Boissard, or a Bahr, or a Julius Bab,
he would be regarded as not quite nice.
Certainly the Drama League would not invite
him to appear before it. Certainly he would
never be invited to sit between Prof. Richard
Burton and Prof. William Lyon Phelps at the
gala banquet to Mr. D. W. Griffith. Certainly,
if his writings got into the paid prints
at all, there would be a discreet editor&#8217;s note
at the top to the effect that &#8220;the publication of
an article does not necessarily imply that it
represents the ideas of this publication or of
its editors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Criticism in America must follow the bell-cow.
The bell-cow is personal cowardice, artistic
cowardice, neighbourhood cowardice, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
the even cheaper cowardice of the daily and&mdash;to
a much lesser degree&mdash;periodical press.
Up to within a few years ago it was out of
the question for a dramatic critic to write
honestly of the productions of David Belasco
and still keep his job. One of the leading
New York evening newspapers peremptorily
discharged its reviewer for daring to do so;
another New York newspaper sternly instructed
its reviewer not to make the same
mistake twice under the penalty of being cashiered;
a leading periodical packed off its reviewer
for the offence. One of the most talented
critics in New York was several years
ago summarily discharged by the newspaper
that employed him because he wrote an honest
criticism of a very bad play by an obscure
playwright named Jules Eckert Goodman.
Another conscientious critic, daring mob opinion
at about the same time&mdash;he wrote, as I
recall, something to the effect that the late
Charles Frohman&#8217;s productions were often
very shoddy things&mdash;was charily transferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
the next day to another post on the newspaper&#8217;s
staff. I myself, ploughing my familiar
modest critical course, have, indeed, been
made not personally unaware of the native
editorial horror of critical opinions which are
not shared by the Night School curricula, the
inmates of the Actors&#8217; Home, the Independent
Order of B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith, the United Commercial
Travelers of America, and the Moose.
Some years ago, a criticism of Hall Caine and
of his play &#8220;Margaret Schiller,&#8221; which ventured
the opinion that the M. Caine was perhaps
not one of the greatest of modern geniuses,
so frightened the editors of the Philadelphia
<i>North American</i> and the Cleveland
<i>Leader</i> that I doubt they have yet recovered
from the fear of the consequences of printing
the review.</p>

<p>The ruling ethic of the American press so
far as the theatre is concerned is one of unctuous
<i>laissez faire</i>. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t praise,
don&#8217;t dispraise,&#8221; is the editorial injunction to
the reviewer. The theatre in America is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
great business&mdash;greater even than the department
store&mdash;and a great business should be
treated with proper respect. What if the
reviewer does not admire &#8220;The Key to
Heaven&#8221;? It played to more than <i>twelve
thousand dollars</i> last week; it <i>must</i> be good.
The theatre must be helped, and the way to
help it is uninterruptedly to speak well of it.
Fine drama? Art? A newspaper has no
concern with fine drama and art; the public is
not interested in such things. A newspaper&#8217;s
concern is primarily with news. But is not
dramatic swindling, the selling of spurious
wares at high prices, news? Is not an attempt
to corrupt the future of the theatre as
an honourable institution and an honourable
business also news, news not so very much less
interesting, perhaps, than the three column account
of an ex-Follies girl&#8217;s adulteries? The
reviewer, for his impertinence, is assigned
henceforth to cover the Jefferson Market
police court.</p>

<p>The key-note of the American journalistic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
attitude toward the theatre is a stagnant
optimism. Dramatic art and the red-haired
copy boy are the two stock jokes of the
American newspaper office. Here and there
one encounters a reviewer who, through
either the forcefulness or the amiability of his
personality, is successful for a short time in
evading the editorial shackles&mdash;there are a few
such still extant as I write. But soon or late
the rattle of the chains is heard and the reviewer
that was is no more. He is an American,
and must suffer the penalty that an
American who aspires to cultured viewpoint
and defiant love of beauty must ever suffer.
For&mdash;so George Santayana, late professor of
philosophy in Harvard University, in &#8220;Character
and Opinion in the United States&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;the
luckless American who is drawn to poetic
subtlety, pious retreats, or gay passions,
nevertheless has the categorical excellence of
work, growth, enterprise, reform, and prosperity
dinned into his ears: every door is open
in this direction and shut in the other; so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
he either folds up his heart and withers in a
corner&mdash;in remote places you sometimes find
such a solitary gaunt idealist&mdash;or else he flies
to Oxford or Florence or Montmartre to save
his soul&mdash;or perhaps not to save it.&#8221;</p>
